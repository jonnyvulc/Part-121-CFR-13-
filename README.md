PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY
§ 121.101 What are SBA size standards?

under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
(b) NAICS is described in the North American Industry Classification Man- ual–United States, which is available from the National Technical Informa- tion Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161; by calling 1(800) 553–6847 or 1(703) 605–6000; or via the Internet at http://www.ntis.gov/products/ naics.aspx. The manual includes defini- tions for each industry, tables showing relationships between 1997 NAICS and 1987 SICs, and a comprehensive index. NAICS assigns codes to all economic activity within twenty broad sectors. Section 121.201 provides a full table of small business size standards matched to the U.S. NAICS industry codes. A full table matching a size standard with each NAICS Industry or U.S. In- dustry code is also published annually by SBA in the FEDERAL REGISTER.

§121.102 How does SBA establish size standards?
(a) SBA considers economic charac- teristics comprising the structure of an industry, including degree of competi- tion, average firm size, start-up costs and entry barriers, and distribution of firms by size. It also considers techno- logical changes, competition from other industries, growth trends, histor- ical activity within an industry, unique factors occurring in the indus- try which may distinguish small firms from other firms, and the objectives of its programs and the impact on those programs of different size standard lev- els.
(b) As part of its review of a size standard, SBA will investigate if any concern at or below a particular stand- ard would be dominant in the industry. SBA will take into consideration mar- ket share of a concern and other appro- priate factors which may allow a con- cern to exercise a major controlling in- fluence on a national basis in which a number of business concerns are en- gaged. Size standards seek to ensure that a concern that meets a specific size standard is not dominant in its field of operation.
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
(c) As part of its review of size stand- ards, SBA’s Office of Size Standards will examine the impact of inflation on monetary-based size standards (e.g., re- ceipts, net income, assets) at least once every five years and submit a report to the Administrator or designee. If SBA finds that inflation has significantly eroded the value of the monetary-based size standards, it will issue a proposed rule to increase size standards.
(d) Please address any requests to change existing size standards or estab- lish new ones for emerging industries to the Division Chief, Office of Size Standards, Small Business Administra- tion, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.
(e) When SBA publishes a final rule in the FEDERAL REGISTER revising, modifying, or establishing a size stand- ard, SBA will include in the final rule, an instruction that interested persons may file a petition for reconsideration of a revised, modified, or established size standard at SBA’s Office of Hear- ings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 cal- endar days after publication of the final rule in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 632(a)(9) and part 134, subpart I of this chapter. The instruction will provide the mailing address, facsimile number, and email address of OHA.
(f) Within 14 calendar days after a pe- tition for reconsideration of a size standard is filed, unless it appears OHA will dismiss the petition for reconsider- ation, SBA will publish a document in the FEDERAL REGISTER announcing the size standard or standards that have been challenged, the FEDERAL REG- ISTER citation of the final rule, the as- signed OHA docket number, and the date of the close of record. The docu- ment will further state that interested parties may contact OHA to intervene in the dispute pursuant to §134.906 of this chapter.
(g) Where OHA grants a petition for reconsideration of a size standard that had been revised or modified, OHA will remand the case to SBA’s Office of Size Standards for further action in accord- ance with § 134.916(a) of this chapter.

§121.103 How does SBA determine af- filiation?
(a) General Principles of Affiliation. (1) Concerns and entities are affiliates of each other when one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. It does not matter whether control is exercised, so long as the power to control exists.
(2) SBA considers factors such as ownership, management, previous rela- tionships with or ties to another con- cern, and contractual relationships, in determining whether affiliation exists.
(3) Control may be affirmative or negative. Negative control includes, but is not limited to, instances where a minority shareholder has the ability, under the concern’s charter, by-laws, or shareholder’s agreement, to prevent a quorum or otherwise block action by the board of directors or shareholders.
(4) Affiliation may be found where an individual, concern, or entity exercises control indirectly through a third party.
(5) In determining whether affiliation exists, SBA will consider the totality of the circumstances, and may find af- filiation even though no single factor is sufficient to constitute affiliation.
(6) In determining the concern’s size, SBA counts the receipts, employees, or other measure of size of the concern whose size is at issue and all of its do- mestic and foreign affiliates, regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit.
(7) For SBA’s Small Business Innova- tion Research (SBIR) and Small Busi- ness Technology Transfer (STTR) pro- grams, the bases for affiliation are set forth in § 121.702.
(8) For applicants in SBA’s Business Loan, Disaster Loan, and Surety Bond Guarantee Programs, the size stand- ards and bases for affiliation are set forth in § 121.301.
(b) Exceptions to affiliation coverage. (1) Business concerns owned in whole or substantial part by investment com- panies licensed, or development compa- nies qualifying, under the Small Busi- ness Investment Act of 1958, as amend- ed, are not considered affiliates of such investment companies or development companies.
§ 121.103
(2)(i) Business concerns owned and controlled by Indian Tribes, Alaska Na- tive Corporations (ANCs) organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs) authorized by 42 U.S.C. 9805, or wholly-owned entities of Indian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs are not consid- ered affiliates of such entities.
(ii) Business concerns owned and con- trolled by Indian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, CDCs, or wholly-owned entities of In- dian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs, are not considered to be affiliated with other concerns owned by these entities because of their common ownership or common management. In addition, af- filiation will not be found based upon the performance of common adminis- trative services so long as adequate payment is provided for those services. Affiliation may be found for other rea- sons.
(A) Common administrative services which are subject to the exception to affiliation include, bookkeeping, pay- roll, recruiting, other human resource support, cleaning services, and other duties which are otherwise unrelated to contract performance or manage- ment and can be reasonably pooled or otherwise performed by a holding com- pany, parent entity, or sister business concern without interfering with the control of the subject firm.
(B) Contract administration services include both services that could be con- sidered ‘‘common administrative serv- ices’’ under the exception to affiliation and those that could not.
(1) Contract administration services that encompass actual and direct day- to-day oversight and control of the per- formance of a contract/project are not shared common administrative serv- ices, and would include tasks or func- tions such as negotiating directly with the government agency regarding pro- posal terms, contract terms, scope and modifications, project scheduling, hir- ing and firing of employees, and overall responsibility for the day-to-day and overall project and contract comple- tion.
(2) Contract administration services that are administrative in nature may constitute administrative services that

can be shared, and would fall within the exception to affiliation. These ad- ministrative services include tasks such as record retention not related to a specific contract (e.g., employee time and attendance records), maintenance of databases for awarded contracts, monitoring for regulatory compliance, template development, and assisting accounting with invoice preparation as needed.
(C) Business development may in- clude both services that could be con- sidered ‘‘common administrative serv- ices’’ under the exception to affiliation and those that could not. Efforts at the holding company or parent level to identify possible procurement opportu- nities for specific subsidiary companies may properly be considered ‘‘common administrative services’’ under the ex- ception to affiliation. However, at some point the opportunity identified by the holding company’s or parent en- tity’s business development efforts be- comes concrete enough to assign to a subsidiary and at that point the sub- sidiary must be involved in the busi- ness development efforts for such op- portunity. At the proposal or bid prep- aration stage of business development, the appropriate subsidiary company for the opportunity has been identified and a representative of that company must be involved in preparing an appropriate offer. This does not mean to imply that one or more representatives of a hold- ing company or parent entity cannot also be involved in preparing an offer. They may be involved in assisting with preparing the generic part of an offer, but the specific subsidiary that intends to ultimately perform the contract must control the technical and con- tract specific portions of preparing an offer. In addition, once award is made, employee assignments and the logistics for contract performance must be con- trolled by the specific subsidiary com- pany and should not be performed at a holding company or parent entity level.
(3) Business concerns which are part of an SBA approved pool of concerns for a joint program of research and de- velopment or for defense production as authorized by the Small Business Act are not affiliates of one another be- cause of the pool.
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
(4) Business concerns which lease em- ployees from concerns primarily en- gaged in leasing employees to other businesses or which enter into a co-em- ployer arrangement with a Profes- sional Employer Organization (PEO) are not affiliated with the leasing com- pany or PEO solely on the basis of a leasing agreement.
(5) For financial, management or technical assistance under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (an applicant is not affiliated with the investors listed in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Venture capital operating compa- nies, as defined in the U.S. Department of Labor regulations found at 29 CFR 2510.3–101(d);
(ii) Employee benefit or pension plans established and maintained by the Federal government or any state, or their political subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, for the benefit of employees;
(iii) Employee benefit or pension plans within the meaning of the Em- ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.);
(iv) Charitable trusts, foundations, endowments, or similar organizations exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 501(c));
(v) Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act) (15 U.S.C. 80a-1, et seq.); and
(vi) Investment companies, as defined under the 1940 Act, which are not reg- istered under the 1940 Act because they are beneficially owned by less than 100 persons, if the company’s sales lit- erature or organizational documents indicate that its principal purpose is investment in securities rather than the operation of commercial enter- prises.
(6) A firm that has an SBA-approved mentor-prote ́ge ́ agreement authorized under §125.9 of this chapter is not af- filiated with its mentor or prote ́ge ́ firm solely because the prote ́ge ́ firm re- ceives assistance from the mentor under the agreement. Similarly, a prote ́ge ́ firm is not affiliated with its mentor solely because the prote ́ge ́ firm

receives assistance from the mentor under a federal mentor-prote ́ge ́ pro- gram where an exception to affiliation is specifically authorized by statute or by SBA under the procedures set forth in §121.903. Affiliation may be found in either case for other reasons as set forth in this section.
(7) The member shareholders of a small agricultural cooperative, as de- fined in the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j), are not considered affiliated with the cooperative by vir- tue of their membership in the cooper- ative.
(8) These exceptions to affiliation and any others set forth in §121.702 apply for purposes of SBA’s SBIR and STTR programs.
(9) In the case of a solicitation for a bundled contract or a Multiple Award Contract with a value in excess of the agency’s substantial bundling thresh- old, a small business contractor may enter into a Small Business Teaming Arrangement with one or more small business subcontractors and submit an offer as a small business without re- gard to affiliation, so long as each team member is small for the size standard assigned to the contract or subcontract. The agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers with due consideration of the ca- pabilities of the subcontractors.
(10)(i) The relationship of a faith- based organization to another organi- zation is not considered an affiliation with the other organization under this subpart if the relationship is based on a religious teaching or belief or other- wise constitutes a part of the exercise of religion. In addition, the eligibility criteria set forth in 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(36)(D) are satisfied for any faith- based organization having not more than 500 employees (including individ- uals employed on a full-time, part- time, or other basis) that pays Federal payroll taxes using its own Internal Revenue Service Employer Identifica- tion Number (EIN) or that would sup- port a deduction under the second sen- tence of 26 U.S.C. 512(b)(12) if the orga- nization generated unrelated business taxable income. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(10), the term ‘‘faith- based organization’’ includes, but is not limited to, any organization associ-
§ 121.103
ated with a church or convention or as- sociation of churches within the mean- ing of 26 U.S.C. 414(e)(3)(D). The term ‘‘organization’’ has the meaning given in 26 U.S.C. 414(m)(6)(A). The terms ‘‘church’’ and ‘‘convention or associa- tion of churches’’ have the same mean- ing that they have in 26 U.S.C. 414.
(ii) No specific process or filing is necessary to claim the benefit of the exemption in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. In applying for a loan under the Paycheck Protection Pro- gram (PPP), a faith-based organization may make all necessary certifications with respect to common ownership or management or other eligibility cri- teria based upon affiliation, if the or- ganization would be an eligible bor- rower but for application of SBA affili- ation rules and if the organization falls within the terms of the exemption de- scribed in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section. If a faith-based organization indicates any relationship that may pertain to affiliation, such as owner- ship of, ownership by, or common man- agement with any other organization, on or in connection with a loan appli- cation, and if the faith-based organiza- tion applying for a loan falls within the terms of the exemption described in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section with respect to that relationship, the faith- based organization may indicate on a separate sheet that it is entitled to the exemption. That sheet may be identi- fied as addendum A, and no further listing of the other organization or de- scription of the relationship to that or- ganization is required. See appendix A to this part for a sample ‘‘Addendum A’’, but the format need not be used as long as the substance is the same.
(c) Affiliation based on stock owner- ship. (1) A person (including any indi- vidual, concern or other entity) that owns, or has the power to control, 50 percent or more of a concern’s voting stock, or a block of voting stock which is large compared to other outstanding blocks of voting stock, controls or has the power to control the concern.
(2) If two or more persons (including any individual, concern or other enti- ty) each owns, controls, or has the power to control less than 50 percent of

§ 121.103
a concern’s voting stock, and such mi- nority holdings are equal or approxi- mately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other stock hold- ing, SBA presumes that each such per- son controls or has the power to con- trol the concern whose size is at issue. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power to control does not in fact exist.
(3) If a concern’s voting stock is widely held and no single block of stock is large as compared with all other stock holdings, the concern’s Board of Directors and CEO or Presi- dent will be deemed to have the power to control the concern in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
(d) Affiliation arising under stock op- tions, convertible securities, and agree- ments to merge. (1) In determining size, SBA considers stock options, convert- ible securities, and agreements to merge (including agreements in prin- ciple) to have a present effect on the power to control a concern. SBA treats such options, convertible securities, and agreements as though the rights granted have been exercised.
(2) Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not considered ‘‘agree- ments in principle’’ and are thus not given present effect.
(3) Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject to conditions precedent which are incapa- ble of fulfillment, speculative, conjec- tural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is shown to be ex- tremely remote, are not given present effect.
(4) An individual, concern or other entity that controls one or more other concerns cannot use options, convert- ible securities, or agreements to appear to terminate such control before actu- ally doing so. SBA will not give present effect to individuals’, concerns’ or other entities’ ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest in order to avoid a finding of affiliation.
(e) Affiliation based on common man- agement. Affiliation arises where one or more officers, directors, managing
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
members, or partners who control the board of directors and/or management of one concern also control the board of directors or management of one or more other concerns.
(f) Affiliation based on identity of inter- est. Affiliation may arise among two or more persons with an identity of inter- est. Individuals or firms that have identical or substantially identical business or economic interests (such as family members, individuals or firms with common investments, or firms that are economically dependent through contractual or other relation- ships) may be treated as one party with such interests aggregated. Where SBA determines that such interests should be aggregated, an individual or firm may rebut that determination with evidence showing that the interests deemed to be one are in fact separate.
(1) Firms owned or controlled by married couples, parties to a civil union, parents, children, and siblings are presumed to be affiliated with each other if they conduct business with each other, such as subcontracts or joint ventures or share or provide loans, resources, equipment, locations or employees with one another. This presumption may be overcome by showing a clear line of fracture be- tween the concerns. Other types of fa- milial relationships are not grounds for affiliation on family relationships.
(2) SBA may presume an identity of interest based upon economic depend- ence if the concern in question derived 70% or more of its receipts from an- other concern over the previous three fiscal years.
(i) This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that despite the contrac- tual relations with another concern, the concern at issue is not solely de- pendent on that other concern, such as where the concern has been in business for a short amount of time and has only been able to secure a limited num- ber of contracts or where the contrac- tual relations do not restrict the con- cern in question from selling the same type of products or services to another purchaser.

is not considered to be affiliated with another concern owned by that entity based solely on the contractual rela- tions between the two concerns.
Example 1 to paragraph (f). Firm A has been in business for 9 months and has two con- tracts. Contract 1 is with Firm B and is val- ued at $900,000 and Contract 2 is with Firm C and is valued at $200,000. Thus, Firm B ac- counts for over 70% of Firm A’s receipts. Ab- sent other connections between A and B, the presumption of affiliation between A and B is rebutted because A is a new firm.
Example 2 to paragraph (f). Firm A has been in business for five years and has approxi- mately 200 contracts. Of those contracts, 195 are with Firm B. The value of Firm A’s con- tracts with Firm B is greater than 70% of its revenue over the previous three years. Un- less Firm A can show that its contractual re- lations with Firm B do not restrict it from selling the same type of products or services to another purchaser, SBA would most likely find the two firms affiliated.
(g) Affiliation based on the newly orga- nized concern rule. Except as provided in § 124.109(c)(4)(iii), affiliation may arise where former or current officers, directors, principal stockholders, man- aging members, or key employees of one concern organize a new concern in the same or related industry or field of operation, and serve as the new con- cern’s officers, directors, principal stockholders, managing members, or key employees, and the one concern is furnishing or will furnish the new con- cern with contracts, financial or tech- nical assistance, indemnification on bid or performance bonds, and/or other facilities, whether for a fee or other- wise. A concern may rebut such an af- filiation determination by dem- onstrating a clear line of fracture be- tween the two concerns. A ‘‘key em- ployee’’ is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or manage- ment of the concern.
(h) Affiliation based on joint ventures. A joint venture is an association of in- dividuals and/or concerns with inter- ests in any degree or proportion in- tending to engage in and carry out business ventures for joint profit over a two year period, for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill, or knowledge, but not on a continuing or permanent basis for
§ 121.103
conducting business generally. This means that a specific joint venture en- tity generally may not be awarded con- tracts beyond a two-year period, start- ing from the date of the award of the first contract, without the partners to the joint venture being deemed affili- ated for the joint venture. Once a joint venture receives a contract, it may submit additional offers for a period of two years from the date of that first award. An individual joint venture may be awarded one or more contracts after that two-year period as long as it sub- mitted an offer including price prior to the end of that two-year period. SBA will find joint venture partners to be affiliated, and thus will aggregate their receipts and/or employees in deter- mining the size of the joint venture for all small business programs, where the joint venture submits an offer after two years from the date of the first award. The same two (or more) entities may create additional joint ventures, and each new joint venture entity may submit offers for a period of two years from the date of the first contract to the joint venture without the partners to the joint venture being deemed af- filiates. At some point, however, such a longstanding inter-relationship or con- tractual dependence between the same joint venture partners will lead to a finding of general affiliation between and among them. A joint venture: Must be in writing; must do business under its own name and be identified as a joint venture in the System for Award Management (SAM) for the award of a prime contract; may be in the form of a formal or informal partnership or exist as a separate limited liability company or other separate legal enti- ty; and, if it exists as a formal separate legal entity, may not be populated with individuals intended to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture (i.e., the joint venture may have its own separate employees to perform ad- ministrative functions, including one or more Facility Security Officer(s), but may not have its own separate em- ployees to perform contracts awarded to the joint venture). SBA may also de- termine that the relationship between a prime contractor and its subcon- tractor is a joint venture pursuant to paragraph (h)(2). For purposes of this

§ 121.103
paragraph (h), contract refers to prime contracts, novations of prime con- tracts, and any subcontract in which the joint venture is treated as a simi- larly situated entity as the term is de- fined in part 125 of this chapter.
Example 1 to paragraph (h) introductory text.
Joint Venture AB receives a contract on April 2, year 1. Joint Venture AB may re- ceive additional contracts through April 2, year 3. On June 6, year 2, Joint Venture AB submits an offer for Solicitation 1. On July 13, year 2, Joint Venture AB submits an offer for Solicitation 2. On May 27, year 3, Joint Venture AB is found to be the apparent suc- cessful offeror for Solicitation 1. On July 22, year 3, Joint Venture AB is found to be the apparent successful offeror for Solicitation 2. Even though the award of the two contracts emanating from Solicitations 1 and 2 would occur after April 2, year 3, Joint Venture AB may receive those awards without causing general affiliation between its joint venture partners because the offers occurred prior to the expiration of the two-year period.
Example 2 to paragraph (h) introductory text.
Joint Venture XY receives a contract on Au- gust 10, year 1. It may receive two additional contracts through August 10, year 3. On March 19, year 2, XY receives a second con- tract. It receives no other contract awards through August 10, year 3 and has submitted no additional offers prior to August 10, year 3. Because two years have passed since the date of the first contract award, after Au- gust 10, year 3, XY cannot receive an addi- tional contract award. The individual parties to XY must form a new joint venture if they want to seek and be awarded additional con- tracts as a joint venture.
Example 3 to paragraph (h) introductory text.
Joint Venture XY receives a contract on De- cember 15, year 1. On May 22, year 3 XY sub- mits an offer for Solicitation S. On Decem- ber 8, year 3, XY submits a novation package for contracting officer approval for Contract C. In January, year 4 XY is found to be the apparent successful offeror for Solicitation S and the relevant contracting officer seeks to novate Contract C to XY. Because both the offer for Solicitation S and the novation package for Contract C were submitted prior to December 15 year 3, both contract award relating to Solicitation S and novation of Contract C may occur without a finding of general affiliation.
(1) Size of joint ventures. (i) A joint venture of two or more business con- cerns may submit an offer as a small business for a Federal procurement, subcontract or sale so long as each con- cern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code as- signed to the contract. For a competi-
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
tive 8(a) procurement, a joint venture between an 8(a) Participant and one or more other small business concerns (in- cluding two firms approved by SBA to be a mentor and prote ́ge ́ under §125.9 of this chapter) must also meet the re- quirements of § 124.513(c) and (d) of this chapter as of the date of the final pro- posal revision for negotiated acquisi- tions and final bid for sealed bidding in order to be eligible for award.
(ii) Two firms approved by SBA to be a mentor and prote ́ge ́ under §125.9 of this chapter may joint venture as a small business for any Federal govern- ment prime contract or subcontract, provided the prote ́ge ́ qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the pro- curement, and the joint venture meets the requirements of § 124.513 (c) and (d), §125.8(b) and (c), §125.18(b)(2) and (3), §126.616(c) and (d), or §127.506(c) and (d) of this chapter, as appropriate. Except for sole source 8(a) awards, the joint venture must meet the requirements of §124.513(c) and (d), §125.8(b) and (c), §125.18(b)(2) and (3), §126.616(c) and (d), or § 127.506(c) and (d) of this chapter, as appropriate, as of the date of the final proposal revision for negotiated acqui- sitions and final bid for sealed bidding. For a sole source 8(a) award, the joint venture must demonstrate that it meets the requirements of §124.513(c) and (d) prior to the award of the con- tract.
(2) Ostensible subcontractors. A con- tractor and its ostensible subcon- tractor are treated as joint venturers for size determination purposes. An os- tensible subcontractor is a subcon- tractor that is not a similarly situated entity, as that term is defined in § 125.1 of this chapter, and performs primary and vital requirements of a contract, or of an order, or is a subcontractor upon which the prime contractor is un- usually reliant. All aspects of the rela- tionship between the prime and sub- contractor are considered, including, but not limited to, the terms of the proposal (such as contract manage- ment, technical responsibilities, and the percentage of subcontracted work), agreements between the prime and sub- contractor (such as bonding assistance or the teaming agreement), and wheth- er the subcontractor is the incumbent

contractor and is ineligible to submit a proposal because it exceeds the appli- cable size standard for that solicita- tion.
(3) Receipts/employees attributable to joint venture partners. For size purposes, a concern must include in its receipts its proportionate share of joint venture receipts, unless the proportionate share already is accounted for in re- ceipts reflecting transactions between the concern and its joint ventures (e.g., subcontracts from a joint venture enti- ty to joint venture partners). In deter- mining the number of employees, a concern must include in its total num- ber of employees its proportionate share of joint venture employees. For the calculation of receipts, the appro- priate proportionate share is the same percentage of receipts or employees as the joint venture partner’s percentage share of the work performed by the joint venture. For the calculation of employees, the appropriate share is the same percentage of employees as the joint venture partner’s percentage ownership share in the joint venture, after first subtracting any joint ven- ture employee already accounted for in one of the partner’s employee count.
Example 1 to paragraph (h)(3). Joint Ven- ture AB is awarded a contract for $10M. The joint venture will perform 50% of the work, with A performing $2M (40% of the 50%, or 20% of the total value of the contract) and B performing $3M (60% of the 50% or 30% of the total value of the contract). Since A will per- form 40% of the work done by the joint ven- ture, its share of the revenues for the entire contract is 40%, which means that the re- ceipts from the contract awarded to Joint Venture AB that must be included in A’s re- ceipts for size purposes are $4M. A must add $4M to its receipts for size purposes, unless its receipts already account for the $4M in transactions between A and Joint Venture AB.
(4) Facility security clearances. A joint venture may be awarded a contract re- quiring a facility security clearance where either the joint venture itself or the individual partner(s) to the joint venture that will perform the nec- essary security work has (have) a facil- ity security clearance.
(i) Where a facility security clear- ance is required to perform primary and vital requirements of a contract, the lead small business partner to the
§ 121.104
joint venture must possess the required facility security clearance.
(ii) Where the security portion of the contract requiring a facility security clearance is ancillary to the principal purpose of the procurement, the part- ner to the joint venture that will per- form that work must possess the re- quired facility security clearance.

§121.104 How does SBA calculate an- nual receipts?
(a) Receipts means all revenue in whatever form received or accrued from whatever source, including from the sales of products or services, inter- est, dividends, rents, royalties, fees, or commissions, reduced by returns and allowances. Generally, receipts are considered ‘‘total income’’ (or in the case of a sole proprietorship ‘‘gross in- come’’) plus ‘‘cost of goods sold’’ as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax re- turn forms (such as Form 1120 for cor- porations; Form 1120S for S corpora- tions; Form 1120, Form 1065 or Form 1040 for LLCs; Form 1065 for partner- ships; Form 1040, Schedule F for farms; Form 1040, Schedule C for other sole proprietorships). Receipts do not in- clude net capital gains or losses; taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income, such as sales or other taxes collected from customers and exclud- ing taxes levied on the concern or its employees; proceeds from transactions between a concern and its domestic or foreign affiliates; and amounts col- lected for another by a travel agent, real estate agent, advertising agent, conference management service pro- vider, freight forwarder or customs broker. For size determination pur- poses, the only exclusions from re- ceipts are those specifically provided for in this paragraph. All other items, such as subcontractor costs, reimburse- ments for purchases a contractor makes at a customer’s request, invest- ment income, and employee-based

costs such as payroll taxes, may not be excluded from receipts.
(1) The Federal income tax return and any amendments filed with the IRS on or before the date of self-certifi- cation must be used to determine the size status of a concern. SBA will not use tax returns or amendments filed with the IRS after the initiation of a size determination.
(2) When a concern has not filed a Federal income tax return with the IRS for a fiscal year which must be in- cluded in the period of measurement, SBA will calculate the concern’s an- nual receipts for that year using any other available information, such as the concern’s regular books of account, audited financial statements, or infor- mation contained in an affidavit by a person with personal knowledge of the facts.
(b) Completed fiscal year means a tax- able year including any short year. ‘‘Taxable year’’ and ‘‘short year’’ have the meanings attributed to them by the IRS.
(c) Period of measurement. (1) Except for the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs, annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 5 or more completed fiscal years means the total receipts of the concern over its most recently completed 5 fiscal years divided by 5. For certifications submitted on or before January 6, 2022, rather than using the definitions in this paragraph (c), a concern submit- ting a certification may elect to cal- culate annual receipts and the receipts of affiliates using either the total re- ceipts of the concern or affiliate over its most recently completed 5 fiscal years divided by 5, or the total receipts of the concern or affiliate over its most recently completed 3 fiscal years di- vided by 3.
(2) Except for the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs, annual re- ceipts of a concern which has been in business for less than 5 complete fiscal years means the total receipts for the period the concern has been in business divided by the number of weeks in busi- ness, multiplied by 52.
(3) Except for the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs, where a con- cern has been in business 5 or more complete fiscal years but has a short
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
year as one of the years within its pe- riod of measurement, annual receipts means the total receipts for the short year and the 4 full fiscal years divided by the total number of weeks in the short year and the 4 full fiscal years, multiplied by 52.
(4) For the Business Loan and Dis- aster Loan Programs, annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for three or more completed fiscal years means the total receipts of the concern over its most recently com- pleted three fiscal years divided by three. Annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for less than three complete fiscal years means the total receipts for the period the concern has been in business divided by the number of weeks in business, mul- tiplied by 52. Where a concern has been in business three or more complete fis- cal years but has a short year as one of the years within its period of measure- ment, annual receipts means the total receipts for the short year and the two full fiscal years divided by the total number of weeks in the short year and the two full fiscal years, multiplied by 52. For the purposes of this section, the Business Loan Programs consist of the 7(a) Loan Program, the Microloan Pro- gram, the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, and the Development Com- pany Loan Program (‘‘504 Loan Pro- gram’’). The Disaster Loan Programs consist of Physical Disaster Business Loans, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Military Reservist Economic In- jury Disaster Loans, and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program loans.
(d) Annual receipts of affiliates. (1) The average annual receipts size of a busi- ness concern with affiliates is cal- culated by adding the average annual receipts of the business concern with the average annual receipts of each af- filiate.
(2) If a concern has acquired an affil- iate or been acquired as an affiliate during the applicable period of meas- urement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the annual re- ceipts used in determining size status includes the receipts of the acquired or acquiring concern. This aggregation applies for the entire period of meas- urement, not just the period after the affiliation arose. However, if a concern

has acquired a segregable division of another business concern during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-cer- tified as small, the annual receipts used in determining size status do not include the receipts of the acquired di- vision prior to the acquisition.
(3) Except for the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs, if the busi- ness concern or an affiliate has been in business for a period of less than 5 years, the receipts for the fiscal year with less than a 12-month period are annualized in accordance with para- graph (c)(2) of this section. Receipts are determined for the concern and its affiliates in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section even though this may result in using a different period of measurement to calculate an affili- ate’s annual receipts.
(4) The annual receipts of a former affiliate are not included if affiliation ceased before the date used for deter- mining size. This exclusion of annual receipts of such former affiliate applies during the entire period of measure- ment, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased. How- ever, if a concern has sold a segregable division to another business concern during the applicable period of meas- urement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the annual re- ceipts used in determining size status will continue to include the receipts of the division that was sold.
(e) Unless otherwise defined in this section, all terms shall have the mean- ing attributed to them by the IRS.

§121.105 How does SBA define ‘‘busi- ness concern or concern’’?
(a)(1) Except for small agricultural cooperatives, a business concern eligi- ble for assistance from SBA as a small business is a business entity organized for profit, with a place of business lo- cated in the United States, and which operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor.
§ 121.106
(2) A small agricultural cooperative is an association (corporate or other- wise) acting pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C.A. 1141j) whose size does not ex- ceed the size standard established by SBA for other similar agricultural small business concerns. A small agri- cultural cooperative’s member share- holders are not considered to be affili- ates of the cooperative by virtue of their membership in the cooperative. However, a business concern or cooper- ative that does not qualify as small under this part may not be a member of a small agricultural cooperative.
(b) A business concern may be in the legal form of an individual proprietor- ship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint venture, association, trust or cooperative, ex- cept that where the form is a joint ven- ture there can be no more than 49 per- cent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture.
(c) A firm will not be treated as a separate business concern if a substan- tial portion of its assets and/or liabil- ities are the same as those of a prede- cessor entity. In such a case, the an- nual receipts and employees of the predecessor will be taken into account in determining size.

§121.106 How does SBA calculate number of employees?
(a) In determining a concern’s num- ber of employees, SBA counts all indi- viduals employed on a full-time, part- time, or other basis. This includes em- ployees obtained from a temporary em- ployee agency, professional employee organization or leasing concern. SBA will consider the totality of the cir- cumstances, including criteria used by the IRS for Federal income tax pur- poses, in determining whether individ- uals are employees of a concern. Volun- teers (i.e., individuals who receive no compensation, including no in-kind compensation, for work performed) are not considered employees.
(b) Where the size standard is number of employees, the method for deter- mining a concern’s size includes the following principles:

§ 121.107
(1) The average number of employees of the concern is used (including the employees of its domestic and foreign affiliates) based upon numbers of em- ployees for each of the pay periods for the preceding completed 12 calendar months.
(2) Part-time and temporary employ- ees are counted the same as full-time employees.
(3) If a concern has not been in busi- ness for 12 months, the average number of employees is used for each of the pay periods during which it has been in business.
(4)(i) The average number of employ- ees of a business concern with affiliates is calculated by adding the average number of employees of the business concern with the average number of employees of each affiliate. If a con- cern has acquired an affiliate or been acquired as an affiliate during the ap- plicable period of measurement or be- fore the date on which it self-certified as small, the employees counted in de- termining size status include the em- ployees of the acquired or acquiring concern. Furthermore, this aggrega- tion applies for the entire period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose.
(ii) The employees of a former affil- iate are not counted if affiliation ceased before the date used for deter- mining size. This exclusion of employ- ees of a former affiliate applies during the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased. However, if a concern has sold a segregable division to another business concern during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-cer- tified as small, the employees used in determining size status will continue to include the employees of the divi- sion that was sold.
[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 69 FR 29203, May 21, 2004; 84 FR 66579, Dec. 5, 2019]
§121.107 How does SBA determine a concern’s ‘‘primary industry’’?
In determining the primary industry in which a concern or a concern com- bined with its affiliates is engaged, SBA considers the distribution of re- ceipts, employees and costs of doing
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
business among the different industries in which business operations occurred for the most recently completed fiscal year. SBA may also consider other fac- tors, such as the distribution of pat- ents, contract awards, and assets.
§121.108 What are the penalties for misrepresentation of size status?
(a) Presumption of Loss Based on the Total Amount Expended. In every con- tract, subcontract, cooperative agree- ment, cooperative research and devel- opment agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or otherwise classi- fied as intended for award to small business concerns, there shall be a pre- sumption of loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is established that a busi- ness concern other than a small busi- ness concern willfully sought and re- ceived the award by misrepresentation.
(b) Deemed Certifications. The fol- lowing actions shall be deemed affirm- ative, willful and intentional certifi- cations of small business size and sta- tus:
(1) Submission of a bid, proposal, ap- plication or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or otherwise classified as in- tended for award to small business con- cerns.
(2) Submission of a bid, proposal, ap- plication or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or cooperative research and development agreement which in any way encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded, as an award to a small business con- cern.
(3) Registration on any Federal elec- tronic database for the purpose of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, coopera- tive agreement, or cooperative re- search and development agreement, as a small business concern.
(c) Signature Requirement. Each offer, proposal, bid, or application for a Fed- eral contract, subcontract, or grant

Small Business Administration
shall contain a certification con- cerning the small business size and sta- tus of a business concern seeking the Federal contract, subcontract or grant. An authorized official must sign the certification on the same page con- taining the size status claimed by the concern.
(d) Limitation of Liability. Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors, technical mal- functions, and other similar situations that demonstrate that a misrepresen- tation of size was not affirmative, in- tentional, willful or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its sub- contractors regarding the subcontrac- tors’ size. Relevant factors to consider in making this determination may in- clude the firm’s internal management procedures governing size representa- tion or certification, the clarity or am- biguity of the representation or certifi- cation requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An individual or firm may not be held liable where govern- ment personnel have erroneously iden- tified a concern as small without any representation or certification having been made by the concern and where such identification is made without the knowledge of the individual or firm.
(e) Penalties for Misrepresentation. (1) Suspension or debarment. The SBA sus- pension and debarment official or the agency suspension and debarment offi- cial may suspend or debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a firm’s size status pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR subpart 9.4.
(2) Civil Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729– 3733, the Program Fraud Civil Rem- edies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3801–3812 and any other applicable laws or regulations, including 13 CFR part 142.
(3) Criminal Penalties. Persons or con- cerns are subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly misrepre- senting the small business size status of a concern in connection with pro- curement programs pursuant to section

(4) Limitation on Liability. An indi- vidual or business concern will not be subject to the penalties imposed under 15 U.S.C. 645(a) where it acted in good faith reliance on a small business sta- tus advisory opinion accepted by SBA under § 121.109.
[78 FR 38816, June 28, 2013, as amended at 80 FR 7536, Feb. 11, 2015; 81 FR 31491, May 19, 2016]
§121.109 What is a small business sta- tus advisory opinion?
(a) Defined. A small business status advisory opinion is a written opinion issued by either a Small Business De- velopment Center (SBDC) operating under part 130 of this chapter or a Pro- curement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) operating under 10 U.S.C. chap- ter 142 which concludes that a firm is entitled to represent itself as a small business concern for purposes of federal government procurement opportuni- ties.
(b) Submission. An SBDC or PTAC must submit a copy of each small busi- ness status advisory opinion it issues to the following Agency official for re- view: Associate General Counsel, Office of Procurement Law, U.S. Small Busi- ness Administration, 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416 or by fax to (202) 205–6390 marked Attn: Small Busi- ness Status Advisory Opinion. A small business status advisory opinion must:
(1) Provide a written analysis ex- plaining the reasoning underlying the SBDC or PTAC’s determination that the covered concern, along with its af- filiates, either does or does not exceed the size standard(s). This analysis must be dated and signed by an SBDC or PTAC business counselor or similarly qualified individual.

§ 121.110
(2) Include, as an attachment, a com- pleted copy of an SBA Form 355 for the covered concern and its affiliates.
(3) Include, as an attachment, copies of the evidence (such as payroll records, time sheets, federal income tax returns, etc.) provided by the cov- ered concern to the SBDC or PTAC clearly documenting its annual re- ceipts and/or number of employees as those terms are defined by §§ 121.104 and 121.106.
(c) Review. Unless a referral is made under paragraph (e) of this section, SBA will decide within 10 business days of receiving a small business status ad- visory opinion to accept or reject it based on its consistency with part 121. SBA will provide written notification of that decision to the SBDC or PTAC that issued the small business status advisory opinion as well as to the cov- ered concern.
(d) Reliance. A concern that receives a small business status advisory opin- ion holding that it does not exceed the applicable size standard(s) may rely upon that determination for purposes of responding to Federal procurement opportunities from the date it is issued unless and until that advisory opinion is rejected by SBA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section or the con- cern undergoes a significant change in its ownership, management, or other factors bearing on its status as a small business concern. However, the firm’s size may be protested by interested parties in connection with a specific procurement.
(e) Referral for size determination. Nothing in this section precludes the Associate General Counsel, Office of Procurement Law from requesting a formal size determination for a con- cern that is the subject of a small busi- ness status advisory opinion pursuant to § 121.1001(b)(9).
(f) Penalties for misrepresentation—(1) Suspension or debarment. The SBA sus- pension and debarment official may suspend or debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a concern’s size for purposes of obtaining a small business size status advisory opinion pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR subpart 9.4.
(2) Civil penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe penalties under
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729– 3733, and under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 331 U.S.C. 3801– 3812, and any other applicable laws.
(3) Criminal Penalties. Persons or con- cerns are subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly misrepre- senting the small business size status of a concern in connection with pro- curement programs pursuant to section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as amended, 18 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 287, and any other appli- cable laws. Persons or concerns are subject to criminal penalties for know- ingly making false statements or mis- representations for the purpose of in- fluencing any actions of SBA pursuant to section 16(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(a), as amended, in- cluding failure to correct ‘‘continuing representations’’ that are no longer true.
[80 FR 7536, Feb. 11, 2015]
§121.110 What must a concern do in order to be identified as a small business concern in any Federal procurement databases?
(a) In order to be identified as a small business concern in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (or any successor thereto), a concern must certify its size in connection with specific size standards at least annu- ally.
(b) If a firm identified as a small business concern in SAM fails to cer- tify its size within one year of a size certification, the firm will not be listed as a small business concern in SAM, unless and until the firm recertifies its size.

2. NAICS code 237990—Dredging: To be con- sidered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern.
3. NAICS code 311421—For purposes of Gov- ernment procurement for food canning and preserving, the standard of 1,000 employees excludes agricultural labor as defined in 3306(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 3306(k).
4. NAICS code 324110—To qualify as small for purposes of Government procurement, the petroleum refiner, including its affili- ates, must be a concern that has either no more than 1,500 employees or no more than 200,000 barrels per calendar day total Oper- able Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation ca- pacity. Capacity includes all domestic and foreign affiliates, all owned or leased facili- ties, and all facilities under a processing agreement or an arrangement such as an ex- change agreement or a throughput. To qual- ify under the capacity size standard, the firm, together with its affiliates, must be primarily engaged in refining crude petro- leum into refined petroleum products. A firm’s ‘‘primary industry’’ is determined in accordance with 13 CFR 121.107.

6. NAICS Subsectors 333, 334, 335 and 336— For rebuilding machinery or equipment on a factory basis, or equivalent, use the NAICS code for a newly manufactured product. Con- cerns performing major rebuilding or over- haul activities do not necessarily have to meet the criteria for being a ‘‘manufacturer’’ although the activities may be classified under a manufacturing NAICS code. Ordi- nary repair services or preservation are not considered rebuilding.
7. NAICS code 336413—Contracts for the re- building or overhaul of aircraft ground sup- port equipment on a contract basis are clas- sified under NAICS code 336413.
8. NAICS Codes 522110, 522120, 522130, 522190, and 522210—A financial institution’s assets are determined by averaging the assets re- ported on its four quarterly financial state- ments for the preceding year. ‘‘Assets’’ for the purposes of this size standard means the assets defined according to the Federal Fi- nancial Institutions Examination Council 041 call report form for NAICS codes 522110, 522120, 522190, and 522210 and the National Credit Union Administration 5300 call report form for NAICS code 522130.

(b) For research and development con- tracts requiring the delivery of a manufac- tured product, the appropriate size standard is that of the manufacturing industry.
(c) For purposes of the Small Business In- novation Research (SBIR) and Small Busi- ness Transfer Technology (STTR) programs, the term ‘‘research’’ or ‘‘research and devel- opment’’ means any activity which is (A) a systematic, intensive study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the subject studied; (B) a systematic study di- rected specifically toward applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need; or (C) a systematic application of knowledge to- ward the production of useful materials, de- vices, and systems or methods, including de- sign, development, and improvement of pro- totypes and new processes to meet specific requirements. See 15 U.S.C. 638(e)(5) and sec- tion 3 of the SBIR and STTR policy direc- tives available at www.sbir.gov. For size eli- gibility requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs, see § 121.702 of this part.
(d) ‘‘Research and Development’’ for guided missiles and space vehicles includes evalua- tions and simulation, and other services re- quiring thorough knowledge of complete missiles and spacecraft.
12. NAICS code 561210—Facilities Support Services:
(a) If one or more activities of Facilities Support Services as defined in paragraph (b) (below in this footnote) can be identified with a specific industry and that industry accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of an entire procurement, then the proper classification of the procurement is that of the specific industry, not Facilities Support Services.
(b) ‘‘Facilities Support Services’’ requires the performance of three or more separate activities in the areas of services or spe- cialty trade contractors industries. If serv- ices are performed, these service activities must each be in a separate NAICS industry. If the procurement requires the use of spe- cialty trade contractors (plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentry, etc.), all such spe- cialty trade contractors activities are con- sidered a single activity and classified as ‘‘Building and Property Specialty Trade Services.’’ Since ‘‘Building and Property Specialty Trade Services’’ is only one activ- ity, two additional activities of separate NAICS industries are required for a procure- ment to be classified as ‘‘Facilities Support Services.’’
13. NAICS code 238990—Building and Prop- erty Specialty Trade Services: If a procure- ment requires the use of multiple specialty trade contractors (i.e., plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentry, etc.), and no specialty trade accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of the procurement, all such specialty trade contractors activities are considered a
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
single activity and classified as Building and Property Specialty Trade Services.
14. NAICS 562910—Environmental Remedi- ation Services:
(a) For SBA assistance as a small business concern in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for Gov- ernment procurement, a concern must be en- gaged primarily in furnishing a range of services for the remediation of a contami- nated environment to an acceptable condi- tion including, but not limited to, prelimi- nary assessment, site inspection, testing, re- medial investigation, feasibility studies, re- medial design, containment, remedial ac- tion, removal of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials and secu- rity and site closeouts. If one of such activi- ties accounts for 50 percent or more of a con- cern’s total revenues, employees, or other re- lated factors, the concern’s primary industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental Remediation Services Indus- try.
(b) For purposes of classifying a Govern- ment procurement as Environmental Reme- diation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore or directly support the restoration of a contaminated environment (such as, preliminary assess- ment, site inspection, testing, remedial in- vestigation, feasibility studies, remedial de- sign, remediation services, containment, re- moval of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials or security and site closeouts), although the general purpose of the procurement need not necessarily in- clude remedial actions. Also, the procure- ment must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., en- gineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with separate, distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to, separate activities in in- dustries such as: Heavy Construction; Spe- cialty Trade Contractors; Engineering Serv- ices; Architectural Services; Management Consulting Services; Hazardous and Other Waste Collection; Remediation Services, Testing Laboratories; and Research and De- velopment in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences. If any activity in the procure- ment can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that in- dustry accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that par- ticular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard.

management and operation of a U.S. Depart- ment of Labor Job Corps Center. The activi- ties involved include admissions activities, life skills training, educational activities, comprehensive career preparation activities, career development activities, career transi- tion activities, as well as the management and support functions and services needed to operate and maintain the facility. For SBA assistance as a small business concern, other than for Federal Government procurements, a concern must be primarily engaged in pro- viding the services to operate and maintain Federal Job Corps Centers.
17. NAICS code 115310 (Support Activities for Forestry)—Forest Fire Suppression and Fuels Management Services are two components of Support Activities for Forestry. Forest Fire Suppression includes establishments which provide services to fight forest fires. These firms usually have fire-fighting crews and equipment. Fuels Management Services firms provide services to clear land of haz- ardous materials that would fuel forest fires. The treatments used by these firms may in- clude prescribed fire, mechanical removal, establishing fuel breaks, thinning, pruning, and piling.
18. NAICS code 541519—An Information Technology Value Added Reseller (ITVAR) provides a total solution to information technology acquisitions by providing multi- vendor hardware and software along with significant value added services. Significant value added services consist of, but are not limited to, configuration consulting and de- sign, systems integration, installation of multi-vendor computer equipment, customization of hardware or software, training, product technical support, mainte- nance, and end user support. For purposes of Government procurement, an information technology procurement classified under this exception and 150-employee size standard must consist of at least 15% and not more than 50% of value added services, as meas- ured by the total contract price. In addition, the offeror must comply with the manufac- turing performance requirements, or comply with the non-manufacturer rule by supplying the products of small business concerns, un- less SBA has issued a class or contract spe- cific waiver of the non-manufacturer rule. If the contract consists of less than 15% of value added services, then it must be classi- fied under a NAICS manufacturing industry. If the contract consists of more than 50% of value added services, then it must be classi- fied under the NAICS industry that best de- scribes the predominate service of the pro- curement.
19. NAICS Sector 92—Small business size standards are not established for this sector. Establishments in the Public Administration sector are Federal, State, and local govern- ment agencies which administer and oversee government programs and activities that are
§ 121.301
not performed by private establishments. Concerns performing operational services for the administration of a government program are classified under the NAICS private sector industry based on the activities performed. Similarly, procurements for these types of services are classified under the NAICS pri- vate sector industry that best describes the activities to be performed. For example, if a government agency issues a procurement for law enforcement services, the requirement would be classified using one of the NAICS industry codes under 56161, Investigation, Guard, and Armored Car Services.
20. NAICS code 511210—For purposes of Gov- ernment procurement, the purchase of soft- ware subject to potential waiver of the non- manufacturer rule pursuant to §121.1203(d) should be classified under this NAICS code.

Disaster Loan, and Surety Bond Guar- antee Programs:
(1) Affiliation based on ownership. For determining affiliation based on equity ownership, a concern is an affiliate of an individual, concern, or entity that owns or has the power to control more than 50 percent of the concern’s voting equity. If no individual, concern, or en- tity is found to control, SBA will deem the Board of Directors or President or Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (or other officers, managing members, or part- ners who control the management of the concern) to be in control of the concern. SBA will deem a minority shareholder to be in control, if that in- dividual or entity has the ability, under the concern’s charter, by-laws, or shareholder’s agreement, to prevent a quorum or otherwise block action by the board of directors or shareholders.
(2) Affiliation arising under stock op- tions, convertible securities, and agree- ments to merge. (i) In determining size, SBA considers stock options, convert- ible securities, and agreements to merge (including agreements in prin- ciple) to have a present effect on the power to control a concern. SBA treats such options, convertible securities, and agreements as though the rights granted have been exercised.
(ii) Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not considered ‘‘agree- ments in principle’’ and are thus not given present effect.
(iii) Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject to conditions precedent which are incapa- ble of fulfillment, speculative, conjec- tural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is shown to be ex- tremely remote, are not given present effect.
(iv) An individual, concern or other entity that controls one or more other concerns cannot use options, convert- ible securities, or agreements to appear to terminate such control before actu- ally doing so. SBA will not give present effect to individuals’, concerns’, or other entities’ ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest in order to avoid a finding of affiliation.
§ 121.301
(3) Affiliation based on management. Affiliation arises where the CEO or President of the applicant concern (or other officers, managing members, or partners who control the management of the concern) also controls the man- agement of one or more other concerns. Affiliation also arises where a single individual, concern, or entity that con- trols the Board of Directors or manage- ment of one concern also controls the Board of Directors or management of one of more other concerns. Affiliation also arises where a single individual, concern or entity controls the manage- ment of the applicant concern through a management agreement.
(4) Affiliation based on identity of interest. Affiliation arises when there is an identity of interest between close relatives, as defined in 13 CFR 120.10, with identical or substantially iden- tical business or economic interests (such as where the close relatives oper- ate concerns in the same or similar in- dustry in the same geographic area). Where SBA determines that interests should be aggregated, an individual or firm may rebut that determination with evidence showing that the inter- ests deemed to be one are in fact sepa- rate.
(5) Affiliation based on franchise and li- cense agreements. The restraints im- posed on a franchisee or licensee by its franchise or license agreement gen- erally will not be considered in deter- mining whether the franchisor or licen- sor is affiliated with an applicant franchisee or licensee provided the ap- plicant franchisee or licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. SBA will only consider the franchise or license agreements of the applicant concern.
(6) Determining the concern’s size. In determining the concern’s size, SBA counts the receipts, employees (§121.201), or the alternate size stand- ard (if applicable) of the concern whose size is at issue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates, regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit.
(7) Exceptions to affiliation. For excep- tions to affiliation, see 13 CFR 121.103(b).

(g) For COVID–19 Economic Injury Disaster (COVID EIDL) loans, an ‘‘af- filiated business’’ or ‘‘affiliate’’ is a business in which an eligible entity has an equity interest or right to profit distributions of not less than 50 per- cent, or in which an eligible entity has the contractual authority to control the direction of the business, provided that such affiliation shall be deter- mined as of any arrangements or agree- ments in existence as of January 31, 2020.

§121.302 When does SBA determine the size status of an applicant?
(a) The size status of an applicant for SBA financial assistance is determined as of the date the application for finan- cial assistance is accepted for proc- essing by SBA, except for applications under the Preferred Lenders Program (PLP), the Disaster Loan program, the SBIC program, and the New Markets Venture Capital (NMCV) program.
(b) For the Preferred Lenders Pro- gram, size is determined as of the date of approval of the loan by the Preferred Lender.
(c) For disaster loan assistance (other than physical disaster loans), size status is determined as of the date the disaster commenced, as set forth in the Disaster Declaration. For pre-dis- aster mitigation loans, size status is determined as of the date SBA accepts a complete Pre-Disaster Mitigation Small Business Loan Application for processing. Refer to §123.408 of this chapter to find out what SBA considers to be a complete Pre-Disaster Mitiga- tion Small Business Loan Application.
(d) For financial assistance from an SBIC licensee or an NMVC company, size is determined as of the date a con- cern’s application is accepted for proc- essing by the SBIC or the NMVC com- pany.
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
(e) Changes in size after the applica- ble date when size is determined will not disqualify an applicant for assist- ance.

§121.303 What size procedures are used by SBA before it makes a for- mal size determination?
(a) A concern that submits an appli- cation for financial assistance is deemed to have certified that it is small under the applicable size stand- ard. SBA may question the concern’s status based on information supplied in the application or from any other source.
(b) A small business investment com- pany, a development company, a surety bond company, or a preferred lender may accept as true the size informa- tion provided by an applicant, unless credible evidence to the contrary is ap- parent.
(c) Size is initially considered by the individual with final financial assist- ance authority. This is not a formal size determination. A formal deter- mination may be requested prior to a denial of eligibility based on size.
(d) An applicant may request a for- mal size determination when assist- ance has been denied for size ineligi- bility. Except for disaster loan eligi- bility, a request for a formal size deter- mination must be made to the Govern- ment Contracting Area Director serv- ing the area in which the headquarters of the applicant is located, regardless of the location of the parent company or affiliates. For disaster loan assist- ance, the request for a size determina- tion must be made to the Area Director for the Disaster Area Office which de- nied the assistance.
(e) There are no time limitations for making a formal size determination for purposes of financial assistance. The official making the formal size deter- mination must provide a copy of the determination to the applicant, to the requesting SBA official, and to other interested SBA program officials.

§121.304 What are the size require- ments for refinancing an existing SBA loan?
(a) A concern that applies to refi- nance an existing SBA loan or guar- antee will be considered small for the refinancing even though its size has in- creased since the date of the original financing to exceed its applicable size standard, provided that:
(1) The increase in size is due to nat- ural growth (as distinguished from merger, acquisition or similar manage- ment action); and
(2) SBA determines that refinancing is necessary to protect the Govern- ment’s financial interest.
(b) If a concern’s size has increased other than by natural growth, the con- cern and its affiliates must be small at the time the application for refi- nancing is accepted for processing by SBA.
§121.305 What size eligibility require- ments exist for obtaining financial assistance relating to particular procurements?
A concern qualified as small for a particular procurement, including an 8(a) subcontract, is small for financial assistance directly and primarily relat- ing to the performance of the par- ticular procurement.

§121.401 What procurement programs are subject to size determinations?
The rules set forth in §§121.401 through 121.413 apply to all Federal procurement programs for which status as a small business is required or ad- vantageous, including the small busi- ness set-aside program, SBA’s Certifi- cate of Competency program, SBA’s 8(a) Business Development program, SBA’s HUBZone program, the Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contract Program, SBA’s Service-Dis- abled Veteran-Owned Small Business program, the Small Business Subcon- tracting program, and the Federal Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program.
[75 FR 62280, Oct. 7, 2010]
§ 121.402
§121.402 What size standards are ap- plicable to Federal Government Contracting programs?
(a) A concern must not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code speci- fied in the solicitation. The con- tracting officer must specify the size standard in effect on the date the solic- itation is issued. If SBA amends the size standard and it becomes effective before the date initial offers (including price) are due, the contracting officer may amend the solicitation and use the new size standard.
(b) The procuring agency contracting officer, or authorized representative, designates the proper NAICS code and corresponding size standard in a solici- tation, selecting the single NAICS code which best describes the principal pur- pose of the product or service being ac- quired. Except for multiple award con- tracts as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, every solicitation, includ- ing a request for quotations, must con- tain only one NAICS code and only one corresponding size standard.
(1) Primary consideration is given to the industry descriptions in the U.S. NAICS Manual, the product or service description in the solicitation and any attachments to it, the relative value and importance of the components of the procurement making up the end item being procured, and the function of the goods or services being pur- chased.
(2) A procurement is generally classi- fied according to the component which accounts for the greatest percentage of contract value. Acquisitions for sup- plies must be classified under the ap- propriate manufacturing or supply NAICS code, not under a Wholesale Trade or Retail Trade NAICS code. A concern that submits an offer or quote for a contract, order, or subcontract where the NAICS code assigned to the contract, order, or subcontract is one for supplies, and furnishes a product it did not itself manufacture or produce, is categorized as a nonmanufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of § 121.406(b).
(c) Multiple Award Contracts (see defi- nition at § 125.1).
(1) For a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer must:

§ 121.403
(i) Assign the solicitation a single NAICS code and corresponding size standard which best describes the prin- cipal purpose of the acquisition as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, only if the NAICS code will also best describe the principal purpose of each order to be placed under the Multiple Award Contract; or
(ii) Divide the solicitation into dis- crete categories (such as Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), Special Item Numbers (SINs), Sectors, Functional Areas (FAs), or the equivalent), and as- sign each discrete category the single NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the prin- cipal purpose of the goods or services to be acquired under that category (CLIN, SIN, Sector, FA or equivalent) as set forth in paragraph (b) of this sec- tion. A concern must meet the applica- ble size standard for each category (CLIN, SIN, Sector, FA or equivalent) for which it seeks an award as a small business concern.
(2)(i) The contracting officer must as- sign a single NAICS code for each order issued against a Multiple Award Con- tract. The NAICS code assigned to an order must be a NAICS code included in the underlying Multiple Award Con- tract. When placing an order under a Multiple Award Contract with multiple NAICS codes, the contracting officer must assign the NAICS code and cor- responding size standard that best de- scribes the principal purpose of each order. In cases where an agency can issue an order against multiple SINs with different NAICS codes, the con- tracting officer must select the single NAICS code that best represents the acquisition. If the NAICS code cor- responding to the principal purpose of the order is not contained in the under- lying Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer may not use the Multiple Award Contract to issue that order.
(ii) With respect to an order issued against a multiple award contract, an agency will receive small business credit for goaling only if the business concern awarded the order has rep- resented its status as small for the un- derlying multiple award contract for the same NAICS code as that assigned to the order, provided recertification
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
has not been required or occurred for the contract or order.
(d) The NAICS code assigned to a pro- curement and its corresponding size standard is final unless timely ap- pealed to SBA’s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), or unless SBA assigns an NAICS code or size standard as pro- vided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e) When a NAICS code designation or size standard in a solicitation is un- clear, incomplete, missing, or prohib- ited, SBA may clarify, complete, or supply a NAICS code designation or size standard, as appropriate, in con- nection with a formal size determina- tion or size appeal.
(f) Any offeror or other interested party adversely affected by an NAICS code designation or size standard des- ignation may appeal the designations to OHA under part 134 of this chapter.

§121.403 Are SBA size determinations and NAICS code designations bind- ing on parties?
Formal size determinations and NAICS code designations made by au- thorized SBA officials are binding upon the parties. Opinions otherwise pro- vided by SBA officials to contracting officers or others are advisory in na- ture, and are not binding or appealable.

§121.402(c)(1)(i), SBA determines size status for the underlying Multiple Award Contract at the time of initial offer (or other formal response to a so- licitation), which includes price, based upon the size standard set forth in the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract, unless the concern was re- quired to recertify under paragraph (g)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(A) Unrestricted Multiple Award Con- tracts. For an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract, if a business concern (including a joint venture) is small at the time of offer and contract-level re- certification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is small for goaling pur- poses for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests a size recertification for a spe- cific order or Blanket Purchase Agree- ment. Except for orders and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contract, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agree- ment under an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract is set-aside exclusively for small business (i.e., small business set-aside, 8(a) small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women- owned small business), a concern must recertify its size status and qualify as a small business at the time it submits its initial offer, which includes price, for the particular order or Blanket Purchase Agreement. However, where the underlying Multiple Award Con- tract has been awarded to a pool of concerns for which small business sta- tus is required, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement under that Mul- tiple Award Contract is set-aside exclu- sively for concerns in the small busi- ness pool, concerns need not recertify their status as small business concerns (unless a contracting officer requests size certifications with respect to a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement).
(B) Set-aside Multiple Award Contracts. For a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside for small business (i.e., small business set-aside, 8(a) small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business), if a business concern (including a joint ven- ture) is small at the time of offer and
§ 121.404
contract-level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is small for each order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests a size recertification for a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.
(ii) Multiple NAICS. If multiple NAICS codes are assigned as set forth in §121.402(c)(1)(ii), SBA determines size status at the time a business con- cern submits its initial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation) which includes price for a Multiple Award Contract based upon the size standard set forth for each discrete category (e.g., CLIN, SIN, Sector, FA or equivalent) for which the business concern submits an offer and rep- resents that it qualifies as small for the Multiple Award Contract, unless the business concern was required to recertify under paragraph (g)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. If the business con- cern (including a joint venture) sub- mits an offer for the entire Multiple Award Contract, SBA will determine whether it meets the size standard for each discrete category (CLIN, SIN, Sector, FA or equivalent).
(A) Unrestricted Multiple Award Con- tracts. For an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract, if a business concern (including a joint venture) is small at the time of offer and contract-level re- certification for discrete categories on the Multiple Award Contract, it is small for goaling purposes for each order issued against any of those cat- egories, unless a contracting officer re- quests a size recertification for a spe- cific order or Blanket Purchase Agree- ment. Except for orders or Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contract, if an order or Blanket Purchase Agree- ment for a discrete category under an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract is set-aside exclusively for small busi- ness (i.e., small business set, 8(a) small business, service-disabled veteran- owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small busi- ness), a concern must recertify its size status and qualify as a small business at the time it submits its initial offer, which includes price, for the particular order or Agreement. However, where

§ 121.404
the underlying Multiple Award Con- tract for discrete categories has been awarded to a pool of concerns for which small business status is required, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agree- ment under that Multiple Award Con- tract is set-aside exclusively for con- cerns in the small business pool, con- cerns need not recertify their status as small business concerns (unless a con- tracting officer requests size certifi- cations with respect to a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement).
(B) Set-aside Multiple Award Contracts. For a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside for small business (i.e., small business set-aside, 8(a) small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business), if a business concern (including a joint ven- ture) is small at the time of offer and contract-level recertification for dis- crete categories on the Multiple Award Contract, it is small for each order or Agreement issued against any of those categories, unless a contracting officer requests a size recertification for a spe- cific order or Blanket Purchase.
(iii) SBA will determine size at the time of initial offer (or other formal re- sponse to a solicitation), which in- cludes price, for an order or Agreement issued against a Multiple Award Con- tract if the contracting officer requests a new size certification for the order or Agreement.
(iv) For an indefinite delivery, indefi- nite quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Contract, where concerns are not re- quired to submit price as part of the offer for the IDIQ contract, size will be determined as of the date of initial offer, which may not include price.
(2) Agreements. With respect to ‘‘Agreements’’ including Blanket Pur- chase Agreements (BPAs) (except for BPAs issued against a GSA Schedule Contract), Basic Agreements, Basic Or- dering Agreements, or any other Agreement that a contracting officer sets aside or reserves awards to any type of small business, a concern must qualify as small at the time of its ini- tial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation), which includes price, for the Agreement. Because an Agreement is not a contract, the concern must also qualify as small for each order
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
issued pursuant to the Agreement in order to be considered small for the order and for an agency to receive small business goaling credit for the order.
(b) Eligibility for SBA programs. A con- cern applying to be certified as a Par- ticipant in SBA’s 8(a) Business Devel- opment program (under part 124, sub- part A, of this chapter), as a HUBZone small business (under part 126 of this chapter), or as a women-owned small business concern (under part 127 of this chapter) must qualify as a small busi- ness for its primary industry classifica- tion as of the date of its application and, where applicable, the date the SBA program office requests a formal size determination in connection with a concern that otherwise appears eligi- ble for program certification.
(c) Certificates of competency. The size status of an applicant for a Certificate of Competency (COC) relating to an un- restricted procurement is determined as of the date of the concern’s applica- tion for the COC.
(d) Nonmanufacturer rule, ostensible subcontractor rule, and joint venture agreements. Compliance with the non- manufacturer rule set forth in §121.406(b)(1), the ostensible subcon- tractor rule set forth in §121.103(h)(2), and the joint venture agreement re- quirements in § 124.513(c) and (d), §125.8(b) and (c), §125.18(b)(2) and (3), §126.616(c) and (d), or §127.506(c) and (d) of this chapter, as appropriate, is de- termined as of the date of the final pro- posal revision for negotiated acquisi- tions and final bid for sealed bidding.
(e) Subcontracting. For subcon- tracting purposes, a concern must qualify as small as of the date that it certifies that it is small for the sub- contract. The applicable size standard is that which is set forth in § 121.410 and which is in effect at the time the con- cern self-certifies that it is small for the subcontract. A prime contractor may rely on the self-certification of subcontractor provided it does not have a reason to doubt the concern’s self-certification.
(f) Two-step procurements. For pur- poses of architect-engineering, design/ build or two-step sealed bidding pro- curements, a concern must qualify as small as of the date that it certifies

that it is small as part of its initial bid or proposal (which may or may not in- clude price).
(g) Effect of size certification and recer- tification. A concern that represents itself as a small business and qualifies as small at the time it submits its ini- tial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation) which includes price is generally considered to be a small busi- ness throughout the life of that con- tract. Similarly, a concern that rep- resents itself as a small business and qualifies as small after a required re- certification under paragraph (g)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is generally considered to be a small business throughout the life of that contract. Where a concern grows to be other than small, the procuring agency may exercise options and still count the award as an award to a small business, except that a required recertification as other than small under paragraph (g)(1), (2), or (3) of this section changes the firm’s status for future options and orders. The following exceptions apply to this paragraph (g):
(1) Within 30 days of an approved con- tract novation, a contractor must re- certify its small business size status to the procuring agency, or inform the procuring agency that it is other than small. If the contractor is other than small, the agency can no longer count the options or orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point for- ward, towards its small business goals.
(2)(i) In the case of a merger, sale, or acquisition, where contract novation is not required, the contractor must, within 30 days of the transaction be- coming final, recertify its small busi- ness size status to the procuring agen- cy, or inform the procuring agency that it is other than small. If the con- tractor is other than small, the agency can no longer count the options or or- ders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its small business goals. The agency and the contractor must immediately re- vise all applicable Federal contract databases to reflect the new size sta- tus.
(ii) Recertification is required:
(A) When a concern, or an affiliate of the concern, acquires or is acquired by another concern;
§ 121.404
(B) From both the acquired concern and the acquiring concern if each has been awarded a contract as a small business; and
(C) In the context of a joint venture that has been awarded a contract or order as a small business, from any partner to the joint venture that has been acquired, is acquiring, or has merged with another business entity.
(iii) If the merger, sale or acquisition occurs after offer but prior to award, the offeror must recertify its size to the contracting officer prior to award. If the merger, sale or acquisition (in- cluding agreements in principal) occurs within 180 days of the date of an offer and the offeror is unable to recertify as small, it will not be eligible as a small business to receive the award of the contract. If the merger, sale or acquisi- tion (including agreements in prin- cipal) occurs more than 180 days after the date of an offer, award can be made, but it will not count as an award to small business.
(iv) Recertification is not required when the ownership of a concern that is at least 51% owned by an entity (i.e., tribe, Alaska Native Corporation, or Community Development Corporation) changes to or from a wholly-owned business concern of the same entity, as long as the ultimate owner remains that entity.
Example 1 to paragraph (g)(2)(iii). Indian Tribe X owns 100% of small business ABC. ABC wins an award for a small business set- aside contract. In year two of contract per- formance, X changes the ownership of ABC so that X owns 100% of a holding company XYZ, Inc., which in turn owns 100% of ABC. This restructuring does not require ABC to recertify its status as a small business be- cause it continues to be 100% owned (indi- rectly rather than directly) by Indian Tribe X.
(3) For the purposes of contracts (in- cluding Multiple Award Contracts) with durations of more than five years (including options), a contracting offi- cer must request that a business con- cern recertify its small business size status no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the con- tract, and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option thereafter. If the contractor certifies that it is other than small, the agency can no longer

count the options or orders issued pur- suant to the contract towards its small business prime contracting goals. A contracting officer may also request size recertification, as he or she deems appropriate, prior to the 120-day point in the fifth year of a long-term mul- tiple award contract. The agency and the contractor must immediately re- vise all applicable Federal contract databases to reflect the new size sta- tus.
(i) A business concern that certified itself as other than small, either ini- tially or prior to an option being exer- cised, may recertify itself as small for a subsequent option period if it meets the applicable size standard.
(ii) Re-certification does not change the terms and conditions of the con- tract. The limitations on subcon- tracting, non-manufacturer and sub- contracting plan requirements in effect at the time of contract award remain in effect throughout the life of the con- tract. However, a contracting officer may require a subcontracting plan if a prime contractor’s size status changes from small to other than small as a re- sult of a size recertification.
(iii) A request for a size re-certifi- cation shall include the size standard in effect at the time of re-certification that corresponds to the NAICS code that that was initially assigned to the contract.
(iv) A contracting officer must assign a NAICS code and size standard to each order under a long-term contract. The NAICS code and size standard assigned to an order must correspond to a NAICS code and size standard assigned to the underlying long-term contract and must be assigned in accordance with §§ 121.402(b) and (c). A concern will be considered small for that order only if it certified itself as small under the same or lower size standard.
(v) Where the contracting officer ex- plicitly requires concerns to recertify their size status in response to a solici- tation for an order, SBA will determine size as of the date the concern submits its self-representation as part of its re- sponse to the solicitation for the order.
(4) The requirements in paragraphs (g)(1), (2), and (3) of this section apply to Multiple Award Contracts. However, if the Multiple Award Contract was
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
set-aside for small businesses, partially set-aside for small businesses, or re- served for small business, then in the case of a contract novation, or merger or acquisition where no novation is re- quired, where the resulting contractor is now other than small, the agency cannot count any new or pending or- ders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its small business goals. This includes set- asides, partial set-asides, and reserves for 8(a) BD Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO SBCs, and ED/WOSBs.
(5) If during contract performance a subcontractor that is not a similarly situated entity performs primary and vital requirements of a contract, the contractor and its ostensible subcon- tractor will be treated as joint ven- turers. See § 121.103(h)(4).
(h) Follow-on contracts. A follow-on or renewal contract is a new contracting action. As such, size is determined as of the date the concern submits a writ- ten self-certification that it is small to the procuring agency as part of its ini- tial offer including price for the follow- on or renewal contract.

§121.405 May a business concern self- certify its small business size sta- tus?
(a) A concern must self-certify it is small under the size standard specified in the solicitation, or as clarified, com- pleted or supplied by SBA pursuant to § 121.402(d).
(b) A contracting officer may accept a concern’s self-certification as true for the particular procurement in- volved in the absence of a written pro- test by other offerors or other credible information which causes the con- tracting officer or SBA to question the size of the concern.

(c) Procedures for protesting the self- certification of an offeror are set forth in §§ 121.1001 through 121.1009.
§121.406 How does a small business concern qualify to provide manu- factured products or other supply items under a small business set- aside, service-disabled veteran- owned small business, HUBZone, WOSB or EDWOSB, or 8(a) con- tract?
(a) General. In order to qualify as a small business concern for a small business set-aside, service-disabled vet- eran-owned small business set-aside or sole source contract, HUBZone set- aside or sole source contract, WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole source con- tract, 8(a) set-aside or sole source con- tract, partial set-aside, or set aside of an order against a multiple award con- tract to provide manufactured products or other supply items, an offeror must either:
(1) Be the manufacturer or producer of the end item being procured (and the end item must be manufactured or pro- duced in the United States); or
(2) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section as a nonmanufacturer, a kit assembler or a supplier under Simplified Acquisi- tion Procedures.
(b) Nonmanufacturers. (1) A firm may qualify as a small business concern for a requirement to provide manufactured products or other supply items as a nonmanufacturer if it:
(i) Does not exceed 500 employees (or 150 employees for the Information Technology Value Added Reseller ex- ception to NAICS Code 541519, which is found at § 121.201, footnote 18);
(ii) Is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;
(iii) Takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equip- ment or facilities in a manner con- sistent with industry practice; and
(iv) Will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor or producer made in the United States, or obtains a waiver of such require- ment pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(2) For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is
§ 121.406
the concern which, with its own facili- ties, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic sub- stances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired. The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or com- ponents were assembled or trans- formed. The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consump- tion, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufac- turing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manu- facturers of the end item. Firms that add substances, parts, or components to an existing end item to modify its performance will not be considered the end item manufacturer where those identical modifications can be per- formed by and are available from the manufacturer of the existing end item:
(i) SBA will evaluate the following factors in determining whether a con- cern is the manufacturer of the end item:
(A) The proportion of total value in the end item added by the efforts of the concern, excluding costs of overhead, testing, quality control, and profit;
(B) The importance of the elements added by the concern to the function of the end item, regardless of their rel- ative value; and
(C) The concern’s technical capabili- ties; plant, facilities and equipment; production or assembly line processes; packaging and boxing operations; la- beling of products; and product warran- ties.
(ii) Firms that provide computer and other information technology equip- ment primarily consisting of compo- nent parts (such as motherboards, video cards, network cards, memory, power supplies, storage devices, and similar items) who install components totaling less than 50% of the value of the end item are generally not consid- ered the manufacturer of the end item.
(3) The nonmanufacturer rule applies only to procurements that have been assigned a manufacturing or supply NAICS code, or the Information Tech- nology Value Added Resellers (ITVAR)

§ 121.406
exception to NAICS code 541519. The nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to contracts that have been assigned a service (except for the ITVAR excep- tion to NAICS code 541519), construc- tion, or specialty trade construction NAICS code.
(4) The nonmanufacturer rule applies only to the supply component of a re- quirement classified as a manufac- turing, supply, or ITVAR contract. If a requirement is classified as a service contract, but also has a supply compo- nent, the nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to the supply component of the requirement. The rental of an item(s) is a service and should be treat- ed as such in the application of the nonmanufacturer rule and the limita- tion on subcontracting.
Example 1 to paragraph (b)(4). A procuring agency seeks to acquire computer integra- tion and maintenance services. Included within that requirement, the agency also seeks to acquire some computer hardware. If the procuring agency determines that the principal nature of the procurement is serv- ices and classifies the procurement as a serv- ices procurement, the nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to the computer hardware portion of the requirement. This means that while a contractor must meet the applicable performance of work requirement set forth in §125.6 for the services portion of the con- tract, the contractor does not have to supply the computer hardware of a small business manufacturer.
Example 2 to paragraph (b)(4). A procuring agency seeks to acquire computer hardware, as well as computer integration and mainte- nance services. If the procuring agency de- termines that the principal nature of the procurement is for supplies and classifies the procurement as a supply procurement, the nonmanufacturer rule applies to the com- puter hardware portion of the requirement. A firm seeking to qualify as a small business nonmanufacturer must supply the computer hardware manufactured by a small business. Because the requirement is classified as a supply contract, the contractor does not have to meet the performance of work re- quirement set forth in §125.6 for the services portion of the contract.
(5) The Administrator or designee may waive the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section under the following two circumstances:
(i) The contracting officer has deter- mined that no small business manufac- turer or processor reasonably can be expected to offer a product meeting the
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
specifications (including period for per- formance) required by a particular so- licitation and SBA reviews and accepts that determination; or
(ii) SBA determines that no small business manufacturer or processor of the product or class of products is available to participate in the Federal procurement market.
(6) The two waiver possibilities iden- tified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section are called ‘‘individual’’ and ‘‘class’’ waivers respectively, and the proce- dures for requesting and granting them are contained in § 121.1204.
(7) SBA’s waiver of the nonmanufac- turer rule means that the firm can sup- ply the product of any size business without regard to the place of manu- facture. However, SBA’s waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule has no effect on requirements external to the Small Business Act which involve domestic sources of supply, such as the Buy American Act or the Trade Agreements Act.
(c) The performance requirements (limitations on subcontracting) and the nonmanufacturer rule do not apply to small business set-aside acquisitions with an estimated value between the micro-purchase threshold and the sim- plified acquisition threshold (as both terms are defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101).
(d) Multiple item acquisitions. (1) If at least 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured by small business con- cerns, then a waiver of the nonmanu- facturer rule is not required. There is no requirement that each and every item acquired in a multiple-item pro- curement be manufactured by a small business.
(2) If more than 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items manufactured by other than small con- cerns, then a waiver is required. SBA may grant a contract specific waiver for one or more items in order to en- sure that at least 50% of the value of the products to be supplied by the non- manufacturer comes from domestic small business manufacturers or are subject to a waiver.

(3) If a small business is both a manu- facturer of item(s) and a nonmanufac- turer of other item(s), the manufac- turer size standard should be applied.

§121.407 What are the size procedures for multiple item procurements?
If a procurement calls for two or more specific end items or types of services with different size standards and the offeror may submit an offer on any or all end items or types of serv- ices, the offeror must meet the size standard for each end item or service item for which it submits an offer. If the procurement calls for more than one specific end item or type of service and an offeror is required to submit an offer on all items, the offeror may qualify as a small business for the pro- curement if it meets the size standard of the item which accounts for the greatest percentage of the total con- tract value.
§121.408 What are the size procedures for SBA’s Certificate of Competency Program?
(a) A firm which applies for a COC must file an ‘‘Application for Small Business Size Determination’’ (SBA Form 355). If the initial review of SBA Form 355 indicates the applicant, in- cluding its affiliates, is small for pur- poses of the COC program, SBA will process the application for COC. If the review indicates the applicant, includ- ing its affiliates is other than small SBA will initiate a formal size deter- mination as set forth in §121.1001(b)(3)(ii). In such a case, SBA will not further process the COC appli- cation until a formal size determina- tion is made.
(b) A concern is ineligible for a COC if a formal SBA size determination finds the concern other than small.

§ 121.409 What size standard applies in an unrestricted procurement for Certificate of Competency pur- poses?
For the purpose of receiving a Cer- tificate of Competency in an unre- stricted procurement, the applicable size standard is that corresponding to the NAICS code set forth in the solici- tation. The offeror need not be the manufacturer of any of the items ac- quired.
[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 30863, May 15, 2000; 81 FR 34259, May 31, 2016]
§121.410 What are the size standards for SBA’s Section 8(d) Subcon- tracting Program?
For subcontracting purposes pursu- ant to sections 8(d) of the Small Busi- ness Act, a concern is small for sub- contracts which relate to Government procurements if it does not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code that the prime contractor believes best de- scribes the product or service being ac- quired by the subcontract. However, subcontracts for engineering services awarded under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 have the same size standard as Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons under NAICS code 541330.

§121.411 What are the size procedures for SBA’s Section 8(d) Subcon- tracting Program?
(a) Prime contractors may rely on the information contained in the Sys- tem for Award Management (SAM) (or any successor system or equivalent database maintained or sanctioned by SBA) as an accurate representation of a concern’s size and ownership charac- teristics for purposes of maintaining a small business source list.
(b) Even if a concern is on a small business source list, it must still qual- ify and self-certify as a small business at the time it submits its offer as a sec- tion 8(d) subcontractor.

size or socioeconomic status, if the so- licitation for the subcontract contains a clause which provides that the sub- contractor verifies by submission of the offer that the size or socioeconomic representations and certifications are accurate and complete. Electronic sub- mission may include any method ac- ceptable to the prime contractor (or subcontractor) including, but not lim- ited to, size representations and certifi- cations made in SAM (or any successor system) and electronic conveyance of subcontractor certifications in prime contractor systems in connection with an offer for a subcontract. Prime con- tractors or subcontractors may not re- quire the use of SAM (or any successor system) for purposes of representing size or socioeconomic status in connec- tion with a subcontract.
(c) Upon determination of the suc- cessful subcontract offeror for a com- petitive subcontract, but prior to award, the prime contractor must in- form each unsuccessful subcontract of- feror in writing of the name and loca- tion of the apparent successful offeror.
(d) The self-certification of a concern subcontracting or proposing to sub- contract under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act may be protested by the contracting officer, the prime contractor, the appropriate SBA offi- cial or any other interested party.
(e) Presumption of Loss Based on the Total Amount Expended. In every con- tract, subcontract, cooperative agree- ment, cooperative research and devel- opment agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or otherwise classi- fied as intended for award to small business concerns, there shall be a pre- sumption of loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is established that a busi- ness concern other than a small busi- ness concern willfully sought and re- ceived the award by misrepresentation.
(f) Deemed Certifications. The fol- lowing actions shall be deemed affirm- ative, willful and intentional certifi- cations of small business size and sta- tus:
(1) Submission of a bid, proposal, ap- plication or offer for a Federal grant,
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or otherwise classified as in- tended for award to small business con- cerns.
(2) Submission of a bid, proposal, ap- plication or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or cooperative research and development agreement which in any way encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded, as an award to a small business con- cern.
(3) Registration on any Federal elec- tronic database for the purpose of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, coopera- tive agreement, or cooperative re- search and development agreement, as a small business concern.
(g) Signature Requirement. Each offer, proposal, bid, or application for a Fed- eral contract, subcontract, or grant shall contain a certification con- cerning the small business size and sta- tus of a business concern seeking the Federal contract, subcontract or grant. An authorized official must sign the certification on the same page con- taining the size status claimed by the concern.
(h) Limitation of Liability. Paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section may be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors, technical mal- functions, and other similar situations that demonstrate that a misrepresen- tation of size was not affirmative, in- tentional, willful or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its sub- contractors regarding the subcontrac- tors’ size. Relevant factors to consider in making this determination may in- clude the firm’s internal management procedures governing size representa- tion or certification, the clarity or am- biguity of the representation or certifi- cation requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An individual or firm may not be held liable where govern- ment personnel have erroneously iden- tified a concern as small without any

SIZE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SALES OR LEASE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY
§121.501 What programs for sales or leases of Government property are subject to size determinations?
Sections 121.501 through 121.512 apply to small business size determinations for the purpose of the sale or lease of Government property, including the Timber Sales Program, the Special Salvage Timber Sales Program, and the sale of Government petroleum, coal and uranium.
§121.502 What size standards are ap- plicable to programs for sales or leases of Government property?
(a) Unless otherwise specified in this part—
(1) A concern primarily engaged in manufacturing is small for sales or leases of Government property if it does not exceed 500 employees;

§ 121.603
§121.603 How does SBA determine whether a Participant is small for a particular 8(a) BD subcontract?
(a) Self certification by Participant. A 8(a) BD Participant must certify that it qualifies as a small business under the NAICS code assigned to a par- ticular 8(a) BD subcontract as part of its initial offer including price to the procuring agency. The Participant also must submit a copy of its offer, includ- ing its self-certification as to size, to the appropriate SBA district office at the same time it submits the offer to the procuring agency. See §121.404 for the time at which size is determined for, and § 121.406 for the applicability of the nonmanufacturer rule to, 8(a) BD procurements.
(b) Verification of size by SBA. Within 30 days of its receipt of a Participant’s size self-certification for a particular 8(a) BD subcontract, the SBA district office serving the geographic area in which the Participant’s principal office is located will review the Participant’s self-certification and determine if it is small for purposes of that subcontract. The SBA district office will review the Participant’s most recent financial statements and other relevant data and then notify the Participant of its deci- sion.
(c) Changes in size between date of self- certification and date of award. (1) Where SBA verifies that the selected Partici- pant is small for a particular procure- ment, subsequent changes in size up to the date of award, except those due to merger with or acquisition by another business concern, will not affect the firm’s size status for that procurement.
(2) Where a Participant has merged with or been acquired by another busi- ness concern between the date of its self-certification and the date of award, the concern must recertify its size status, and SBA must verify the new certification before award can occur.
(3) Recertification is not required when the ownership of a concern that is at least 51% owned by an entity (i.e., tribe, Alaska Native Corporation, or Community Development Corporation) changes to or from a wholly-owned business concern of the same entity, as long as the ultimate owner remains that entity.
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
(d) Finding Participant to be other than small. (1) A Participant may request a formal size determination (pursuant to §§121.1001 through 121.1009) with the SBA Government Contracting Area Of- fice serving the geographic area in which the principal office of the Par- ticipant is located within 5 working days of its receipt of notice from the SBA district office that it is not small for a particular 8(a) BD subcontract.
(2) Where the Participant does not timely request a formal size deter- mination, SBA may accept the pro- curement in support of another Partic- ipant, or may rescind its acceptance of the offer for the 8(a) BD program, as appropriate.
[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 30863, May 15, 2000; 69 FR 29206, May 21, 2004; 85 FR 66182, Oct. 16, 2020]
§121.604 Are 8(a) BD Participants con- sidered small for purposes of other SBA assistance?
A concern which SBA determines to be a small business for the award of a 8(a) BD subcontract will be considered to have met applicable size eligibility requirements of other SBA programs where that assistance directly and pri- marily relates to the performance of the 8(a) BD subcontract in question.

To be eligible for award of funding agreements in SBA’s SBIR and STTR programs, a business concern must meet the requirements below at the time of award of an SBIR or STTR Phase I or Phase II funding agreement:
(a) Ownership and control for the SBIR program. (1) An SBIR awardee must:
(i) Be a concern which is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by one or more individuals (who are citi- zens or permanent resident aliens of the United States), other small busi- ness concerns (each of which is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens or per- manent resident aliens of the United States), an Indian tribe, ANC or NHO (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe, ANC or NHO), or any com- bination of these;
(ii) Be a concern which is more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital
§ 121.702
operating companies, hedge funds, pri- vate equity firms, or any combination of these (for agencies electing to use the authority in 15 U.S.C. 638(dd)(1)); or
(iii) Be a joint venture in which each entity to the joint venture must meet the requirements set forth in para- graph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this sec- tion. A joint venture that includes one or more concerns that meet the re- quirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section must comply with §121.705(b) concerning registration and proposal requirements.
(2) No single venture capital oper- ating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm may own more than 50% of the concern unless that single venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm qualifies as a small business concern that is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens or per- manent resident aliens of the United States.
(3) If an Employee Stock Ownership Plan owns all or part of the concern, each stock trustee and plan member is considered an owner.
(4) If a trust owns all or part of the concern, each trustee and trust bene- ficiary is considered an owner.
(b) Ownership and control for the STTR program. (1) An STTR awardee must:
(i) Be a concern which is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by one or more individuals (who are citi- zens or permanent resident aliens of the United States), other small busi- ness concerns (each of which is more than 50% directly owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens or per- manent resident aliens of the United States), an Indian tribe, ANC or NHO (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe, ANC or NHO), or any com- bination of these; or
(ii) Be a joint venture in which each entity to the joint venture must meet the requirements set forth in para- graph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) If an Employee Stock Ownership Plan owns all or part of the concern, each stock trustee and plan member is considered an owner.
(3) If a trust owns all or part of the concern, each trustee and trust bene- ficiary is considered an owner.

§ 121.702
(c) Size and affiliation. An SBIR or STTR awardee, together with its affili- ates, must not have more than 500 em- ployees. Concerns and entities are af- filiates of each other when one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. It does not matter whether control is exer- cised, so long as the power to control exists. For the purposes of the SBIR and STTR programs, the following bases of affiliation apply:
(1) Affiliation based on ownership. For determining affiliation based on equity ownership, a concern is an affiliate of an individual, concern, or entity that owns or has the power to control more than 50 percent of the concern’s voting equity. However, SBA may find a con- cern an affiliate of an individual, con- cern, or entity that owns or has the power to control 40% or more of the voting equity based upon the totality of circumstances. If no individual, con- cern, or entity is found to control, SBA will deem the Board of Directors to be in control of the concern.
(2) Affiliation arising under stock op- tions, convertible securities, and agree- ments to merge. In determining size, SBA considers stock options, convert- ible securities, and agreements to merge (including agreements in prin- ciple) to have a present effect on the power to control a concern. SBA treats such options, convertible securities, and agreements as though the rights granted have been exercised.
(i) Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not considered ‘‘agree- ments in principle’’ and are thus not given present effect.
(ii) Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject to conditions precedent which are incapa- ble of fulfillment, speculative, conjec- tural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is shown to be ex- tremely remote, are not given present effect.
(iii) An individual, concern or other entity that controls one or more other concerns cannot use options, convert- ible securities, or agreements to appear
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
to terminate such control before actu- ally doing so. SBA will not give present effect to individuals’, concerns’ or other entities’ ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest in order to avoid a finding of affiliation.
(3) Affiliation based on common man- agement. Affiliation arises where the CEO or President of a concern (or other officers, managing members, or part- ners who control the management of the concern) also controls the manage- ment of one or more other concerns. Affiliation also arises where a single individual, concern, or entity that con- trols the board of directors of one con- cern also controls the board of direc- tors or management of one or more other concerns.
(4) Affiliation based on identity of inter- est. Affiliation may arise among two or more persons (including any indi- vidual, concern or other entity) with an identity of interest. An individual, concern or entity may rebut a deter- mination of identity of interest with evidence showing that the interests deemed to be one are in fact separate.
(i) SBA may presume an identity of interest between family members with identical or substantially identical business or economic interests (such as where the family members operate con- cerns in the same or similar industry in the same geographic area).
(ii) SBA may presume an identity of interest based upon economic depend- ence if the SBIR/STTR awardee relies upon another concern or entity for 70% or more of its receipts.
(iii) An SBIR or STTR awardee is not affiliated with a portfolio company of a venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm, solely on the basis of one or more shared investors, though affiliation may be found for other reasons.
(5) Affiliation based on the newly orga- nized concern rule. Affiliation may arise where former or current officers, direc- tors, principal stockholders, managing members, general partners, or key em- ployees of one concern organize a new concern in the same or related industry or field of operation, and serve as the new concern’s officers, directors, prin- cipal stockholders, managing members, general partners, or key employees, and the one concern is furnishing or

Small Business Administration
will furnish the new concern with con- tracts, financial or technical assist- ance, indemnification on bid or per- formance bonds, and/or other facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise. A con- cern may rebut such an affiliation de- termination by demonstrating a clear line of fracture between the two con- cerns. A ‘‘key employee’’ is an em- ployee who, because of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the oper- ations or management of the concern. A concern will be considered ‘‘new’’ for the purpose of this rule if it has been actively operating continuously for less than one year.
(6) Size requirement for joint ventures. Two or more small business concerns may submit an application as a joint venture. The joint venture will qualify as small as long as each concern is small under the size standard for the SBIR program, found at §121.702(c), or the joint venture meets the exception at §121.103(h)(3)(ii) for two firms ap- proved to be a mentor and prote ́ge ́ under SBA’s All Small Mentor-Prote ́ge ́ Program.
(7) Affiliation based on the ostensible subcontractor rule. A concern and its os- tensible subcontractor are treated as joint venturers, and therefore affili- ates, for size determination purposes. An ostensible subcontractor is a sub- contractor or subgrantee that performs primary and vital requirements of a funding agreement (i.e., those require- ments associated with the principal purpose of the funding agreement), or a subcontractor or subgrantee upon which the concern is unusually reliant. All aspects of the relationship between the concern and subcontractor are con- sidered, including, but not limited to, the terms of the proposal (such as man- agement, technical responsibilities, and the percentage of subcontracted work) and agreements between the con- cern and subcontractor or subgrantee (such as bonding assistance or the teaming agreement). To determine whether a subcontractor performs pri- mary and vital requirements of a fund- ing agreement, SBA will consider whether the concern’s proposal com- plies with the performance require- ments of the SBIR or STTR program.
§ 121.702
(8) Affiliation based on license agree- ments. SBA will consider whether there is a license agreement concerning a product or trademark which is critical to operation of the licensee. The li- cense agreement will not cause the li- censor to be affiliated with the licensee if the licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of loss. Affiliation may arise, however, through other means, such as common ownership or common management.
(9) Exception to affiliation for portfolio companies. If a venture capital oper- ating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm that is determined to be af- filiated with an awardee is a minority investor in the awardee, the awardee is not affiliated with a portfolio company of the venture capital operating com- pany, hedge fund, or private equity firm, unless:
(i) The venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private equity firm owns a majority of the portfolio company; or
(ii) The venture capital operating company, hedge fund, or private equity firms holds a majority of the seats of the board of directors of the portfolio company.
(10) Totality of the circumstances. In determining whether affiliation exists, SBA may consider the totality of the circumstances, and may find affiliation even though no single factor is suffi- cient to constitute affiliation.
(d) Calculating ownership and control. SBA will review the small business’ eq- uity ownership on a fully diluted basis for purposes of determining ownership, control and affiliation in the SBIR and STTR programs. This means that SBA will consider the total number of shares or equity that would be out- standing if all possible sources of con- version were exercised, including, but not limited to: Outstanding common stock or equity, outstanding preferred stock (on a converted to common basis) or equity, outstanding warrants (on an as exercised and converted to common basis), outstanding options and options reserved for future grants, and any

§121.703 Are formal size determina- tions binding on parties?
Size determinations by authorized SBA officials are formal actions based upon a specific funding agreement, and are binding upon the parties. Other SBA opinions provided to funding agreement officers or others, are only advisory, and are not binding or ap- pealable.
§121.704 When does SBA determine the size and eligibility status of a business concern?
(a) The size and eligibility status of a concern for the purpose of a funding agreement award under the SBIR and STTR programs is determined at the time of award for both Phase I and Phase II SBIR and STTR awards, or on the date of the request for a size deter- mination, if an award is pending.
(b) A concern that qualified as a small business at the time it receives an SBIR or STTR funding agreement is considered a small business throughout the life of that specific funding agree- ment. Where a concern grows to be other than small, the funding agree- ment agency may exercise the options on the award that is a contract, grant or cooperative agreement or issue a continuation on a grant or cooperative agreement and still count the award as an award to a small business under the SBIR or STTR program. However, the following exceptions apply:
(1) In the case of a merger or acquisi- tion, the awardee must, within 30 days of the transaction becoming final (or the approved funding agreement nova- tion if a novation is required), recertify its small business size status to the funding agreement agency or inform the funding agreement agency that it is other than small. If the awardee is other than small, the agency can no longer fund the options or issue a con- tinuation pursuant to the funding agreement, from that point forward, with SBIR or STTR funds. Funding agreement novations for reasons other
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
than a merger or acquisition do not necessarily require re-certification. The funding agreement agency and the awardee must immediately revise all applicable Federal contract and grant databases to reflect the new size status from that point forward.
(2) For the purposes of SBIR and STTR funding agreements with dura- tions of more than five years, a funding agreement officer must request that a business concern re-certify its small business size status no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the funding agreement, and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option or issuing any continuation. If the awardee certifies that it is other than small, the funding agreement agency can no longer fund the options or issue a continuation pursuant to the funding agreement with SBIR or STTR funds. The funding agreement agency and the awardee must immediately re- vise all applicable Federal contract and grant databases to reflect the new size status from that point forward.
(c) Re-certification does not change the terms and conditions of the funding agreement. The requirements in effect at the time of award remain in effect throughout the life of the funding agreement.
(d) A request for a size re-certifi- cation shall include the size standard in effect at the time of re-certification.
[77 FR 76226, Dec. 27, 2012]
§121.705 Must a business concern self- certify its size and eligibility sta- tus?
(a) A business concern must self-cer- tify that it meets the eligibility re- quirements set forth in §121.702 for a Phase I or Phase II SBIR or STTR funding agreement.
(b) A business concern that is more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms and a joint venture where one or more par- ties to the joint venture is more than 50% owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms must be registered with SBA as of the date it submits its initial proposal (or other formal re- sponse) to a Phase I or Phase II SBIR

announcement or solicitation. The con- cern must indicate in any SBIR pro- posal or application that it is reg- istered with SBA as majority-owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private eq- uity firms.
(c) A small business concern that did not meet the requirements of para- graph (b) of this section at the time of its SBIR proposal or application must notify the funding agreement officer if, on the date of award, the concern is more than 50% owned by multiple ven- ture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms.
(1) The concern is still eligible to re- ceive the award if it becomes majority- owned by multiple venture capital op- erating companies, hedge funds, or pri- vate equity firms after the time it sub- mitted its initial proposal (or other formal response) to a Phase I or Phase II SBIR announcement or solicitation if the agency makes the award on or after the date that is 9 months from the end of the period for submitting ap- plications under the SBIR solicitation.
(2) This small business, known as a covered small business concern, would have to certify that it meets the re- quirements of the SBIR program set forth in §§121.702(a)(1)(ii) or 121.702(a)(1)(iii), and 121.702(a)(2) and 121.702(c) at the time of award of the funding agreement.
(d) A funding agreement officer may accept a concern’s self-certification as true for the particular funding agree- ment involved in the absence of a writ- ten protest or other credible informa- tion which would cause the funding agreement officer or SBA to question the size or eligibility of the concern.
(e) Procedures for protesting an awardee’s self-certification are set forth in §§121.1001 through 121.1009. In adjudicating a protest, SBA may ad- dress both the size status and eligi- bility of the SBIR or STTR awardee.

SIZE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PAYING REDUCED PATENT FEES
§ 121.801 May patent fees be reduced if a concern is small?
These sections apply to size status for the purpose of paying reduced pat-
§ 121.805
ent fees authorized by Pub. L. 97–247, 96 Stat. 317. The eligibility requirements for independent inventors and non- profit organizations for the purpose of paying reduced patent fees are set forth in regulations of the Patent and Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce, 37 CFR 1.9, 1.27, 1.28.
§121.802 What size standards are ap- plicable to reduced patent fees pro- grams?
A concern eligible for reduced patent fees is one:
(a) Whose number of employees, in- cluding affiliates, does not exceed 500 persons; and
(b) Which has not assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed (and is under no obligation to do so) any rights in the invention to any person who made it and could not be classified as an inde- pendent inventor, or to any concern which would not qualify as a non-profit organization or a small business con- cern under this section.
§121.803 Are formal size determina- tions binding on parties?
Size determinations by authorized SBA officials are formal actions, based upon a specific patent application pur- suant to the rules of the Patent and Trademark Office, Department of Com- merce, and are binding upon the par- ties. Other SBA opinions provided to patent applicants or others are only advisory, and are not binding or ap- pealable.
§121.804 When does SBA determine the size status of a business con- cern?
Size status is determined as of the date of the patent applicant’s written verification of size.
§121.805 May a business concern self- certify its size status?
(a) A concern verifies its size status with its submission of its patent appli- cation.
(b) Any attempt to establish small size status improperly (fraudulently, through gross negligence, or otherwise) may result in remedial action by the Patent and Trademark Office.

§ 121.901
(c) In the absence of credible infor- mation indicating otherwise, the Pat- ent and Trademark Office may accept the verification by the concern as a small business as true.
(d) Questions concerning the size verification are resolved initially by the Patent and Trademark Office. If not verified as small, the applicant may request a formal SBA size deter- mination.
SIZE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PROGRAMS OF OTHER AGENCIES
§121.901 Can other Government agen- cies obtain SBA size determina- tions?
Upon request by another Government agency, SBA will provide a size deter- mination, under SBA rules, standards and procedures, for its use in deter- mining compliance with small business requirements of its statutes, regula- tions or programs.
§ 121.902 What size standards are ap- plicable to programs of other agen- cies?
SBA size standards. The size standards for compliance with programs of other agencies are those for SBA programs which are most comparable to the pro- grams of such other agencies, unless the agency and SBA agree otherwise.
[67 FR 13716, Mar. 26, 2002]
§121.903 How may an agency use size standards for its programs that are different than those established by SBA?
(a) Federal agencies or departments promulgating regulations relating to small businesses usually use SBA size criteria. In limited circumstances, if they decide the SBA size standard is not suitable for their programs, then agency heads may establish a more ap- propriate small business definition for the exclusive use in such programs, but only when:
(1) The size standard will determine:
(i) The size of a manufacturing con- cern by its average number of employ- ees based on the preceding twelve cal- endar months, determined according to § 121.106;
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
(ii) The size of a services concern by its average annual receipts over a pe- riod of at least 5 years, determined ac- cording to § 121.104;
(iii) The size of other concerns on data over a period of at least 5 years, determined according to § 121.104; or,
(iv) Other factors approved by SBA;
(2) The agency has consulted in writ- ing with SBA’s Division Chief, office of Size Standards at least fourteen (14) calendar days before publishing the proposed rule which is part of the rule- making process. The written consulta- tion will include:
(i) What size standard the agency contemplates using;
(ii) To what agency program it will apply;
(iii) How the agency arrived at this particular size standard for this pro- gram; and,
(iv) Why SBA’s existing size stand- ards do not satisfy the program re- quirements;
(3) The agency proposes the size standard for public comment pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553;
(4) The agency provides a copy of the proposed rule, when it publishes it for public comment as part of the rule- making process, to SBA’s Division Chief, Office of Size Standards; and
(5) SBA’s Administrator approves the size standard before the agency adopts a final rule or otherwise prescribes the size standard for its use. The agency’s request for the SBA Administrator’s approval must include:
(i) Copies of all comments on the pro- posed size standard received in re- sponse to the proposed rule;
(ii) A separate written justification for the intended size standard;
(iii) A copy of the intended final rule if available at that time, or a copy of the intended final rule and preamble prior to its publication; and
(iv) Other information SBA may re- quest in connection with the request.
(b) When approving any size standard established pursuant to this section, SBA’s Administrator will ensure that the size standard varies from industry to industry to the extent necessary to reflect the differing characteristics of the various industries, and consider other relevant factors.

The time limitations in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to con- tracting officers, funding agreement of- ficers or SBA, and they may file pro- tests before or after awards, except to the extent set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, including for purposes of the SBIR and STTR programs. Not- withstanding paragraph (e), for pur- poses of the SBIR and STTR programs the funding agreement officer or SBA may file a protest in anticipation of an award.
(c) Effect of contract award. A timely filed protest applies to the procure- ment in question even though a con- tracting officer awarded the contract prior to receipt of the protest.
(d) Untimely protests. A protest re- ceived after the allotted time limits
§ 121.1006
must still be forwarded to SBA. SBA will dismiss untimely protests.
(e) Premature protests. A protest filed by any party, including the con- tracting officer, before bid opening or notification to offerors of the selection of the apparent successful offer will be dismissed as premature.

§121.1005 How must a protest be filed with the contracting officer?
A protest must be delivered to the contracting officer by hand, telegram, mail, facsimile, Federal Express or other overnight delivery service, e- mail, or telephone. If a protest is made by telephone, the contracting officer must later receive a confirming letter either within the 5-day period in §121.1004(a)(1) or postmarked no later than one day after the date of the tele- phone protest.

§121.1006 When will a size protest be referred to an SBA Government Contracting Area Office?
(a) A contracting officer who receives a protest (other than from SBA) must forward the protest promptly to the SBA Government Contracting Area Of- fice serving the area in which the head- quarters of the offeror is located.
(b) A contracting officer’s referral must contain the following informa- tion:
(1) The protest and any accom- panying materials;
(2) A copy of the self-certification as to size;
(3) Identification of the applicable size standard;
(4) A copy of the solicitation;
(5) Identification of the date of bid opening or notification provided to un- successful offerors;
(6) The date on which the protest was received; and
(7) A complete address and point of contact for the protested concern.

§ 121.1007
§ 121.1007 Must a protest of size status relate to a particular procurement and be specific?
(a) Particular procurement. A protest challenging the size of a concern which does not pertain to a particular pro- curement or sale will not be acted on by SBA.
(b) A protest must include specific facts. A protest must be sufficiently specific to provide reasonable notice as to the grounds upon which the protested con- cern’s size is questioned. Some basis for the belief or allegation stated in the protest must be given. A protest merely alleging that the protested con- cern is not small or is affiliated with unnamed other concerns does not specify adequate grounds for the pro- test. No particular form is prescribed for a protest. Where materials sup- porting the protest are available, they should be submitted with the protest.
(c) Non-specific protests will be dis- missed. Protests which do not contain sufficient specificity will be dismissed by SBA. The following are examples of allegation specificity:
Example 1: An allegation that concern X is large because it employs more than 500 em- ployees (where 500 employees is the applica- ble size standard) without setting forth a basis for the allegation is non-specific.
Example 2: An allegation that concern X is large because it exceeds the 500 employee size standard (where 500 employees is the ap- plicable size standard) because a higher em- ployment figure was published in publication Y is sufficiently specific.
Example 3: An allegation that concern X is affiliated with concern Y without setting forth any basis for the allegation is non-spe- cific.
Example 4: An allegation that concern X is affiliated with concern Y because Mr. A is the majority shareholder in both concerns is sufficiently specific.
Example 5: An allegation that concern X has revenues in excess of $5 million (where $5 million is the applicable size standard) with- out setting forth a basis for the allegation is non-specific.
Example 6: An allegation that concern X exceeds the size standard (where the applica- ble size standard is $5 million) because it re- ceived Government contracts in excess of $5 million last year is sufficiently specific.

§ 121.1008 What occurs after SBA re- ceives a size protest or request for a formal size determination?
(a) When SBA receives a size protest, the SBA Area Director for Government Contracting, or designee, will notify the contracting officer, the protested concern, and the protestor that the protest has been received. If the pro- test pertains to a requirement involv- ing SBA’s HUBZone program, the Area Director will also notify the D/HUB of the protest. If the protest pertains to a requirement set aside for WOSBs or EDWOSBs, the Area Director will also notify SBA’s Director for Government Contracting of the protest. If the pro- test pertains to a requirement involv- ing SBA’s SBIR or STTR programs, the Area Director will also notify the Asso- ciate Administrator, Investment Divi- sion. If the protest involves the size status of an SDB concern (see part 124, subpart B of this chapter) the Area Di- rector will notify SBA’s Associate Ad- ministrator for Business Development. If the protest pertains to a requirement that has been reserved for competition among eligible 8(a) BD program par- ticipants, the Area Director will notify the SBA district office servicing the 8(a) concern whose size status has been protested. SBA will provide a copy of the protest to the protested concern to- gether with SBA Form 355, Application for Small Business Size Determination, by certified mail, return receipt re- quested, or by any overnight delivery service that provides proof of receipt. SBA will ask the protested concern to complete the form and respond to the allegations in the protest.
(b) When SBA receives a request for a formal size determination in accord with §121.1001(b), SBA will provide a blank copy of SBA Form 355 to the con- cern whose size is at issue.
(c) The protested concern or concern whose size is at issue must return the completed SBA Form 355 and all other requested information to SBA within 3 working days from the date of receipt of the blank form from SBA. SBA has discretion to grant an extension of time to file the form. The firm must attach to the completed SBA Form 355 its answers to the allegations con- tained in the protest, where applicable, together with any supporting material.

(d) If a concern whose size status is at issue fails to submit a completed SBA Form 355, responses to the allega- tions of the protest, or other requested information within the time allowed by SBA, or if it submits incomplete infor- mation, SBA may presume that disclo- sure of the information required by the form or other missing information would demonstrate that the concern is other than a small business. A concern whose size status is at issue must fur- nish information about its alleged af- filiates to SBA, despite any third party claims of privacy or confidentiality, because SBA will not disclose informa- tion obtained in the course of a size de- termination except as permitted by Federal law.

§121.1009 What are the procedures for making the size determination?
(a) Time frame for making size deter- mination. (1) After receipt of a protest or a request for a formal size deter- mination, the SBA Area Office will issue a formal size determination with- in 15 business days, if possible.
(2) The contracting officer may award a contract after receipt of a pro- test if the contracting officer deter- mines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section apply to the procurement in question.
(3) If SBA does not issue its deter- mination within 15 business days (or request an extension that is granted), the contracting officer may award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its deter- mination will be disadvantageous to the Government. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section apply to the procurement in question.
(b) Basis for determination. The size determination will be based primarily on the information supplied by the protestor or the entity requesting the
§ 121.1009
size determination and that provided by the concern whose size status is at issue. The determination, however, may also be based on grounds not raised in the protest or request for size determination. SBA may use other in- formation and may make requests for additional information to the protestor, the concern whose size sta- tus is at issue and any alleged affili- ates, or other parties.
(c) Burden of persuasion. The concern whose size is under consideration has the burden of establishing its small business size.
(d) Weight of evidence. SBA will give greater weight to specific, signed, fac- tual evidence than to general, unsup- ported allegations or opinions. In the case of refusal or failure to furnish re- quested information within a required time period, SBA may assume that dis- closure would be contrary to the inter- ests of the party failing to make disclo- sure.
(e) Formal size determination. The SBA will base its formal size determination upon the record, including reasonable inferences from the record, and will state in writing the basis for its find- ings and conclusions.
(f) Notification of determination. SBA will promptly notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern. SBA will send the notification by verifiable means, which may include facsimile, electronic mail, or overnight delivery service.
(g) Results of an SBA Size Determina- tion. (1) A contracting officer may award a contract to a protested con- cern after the SBA Area Office has de- termined either that the protested con- cern is an eligible small business or has dismissed all protests against it. If OHA subsequently overturns the Area Office’s determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in ques- tion.
(2) A contracting officer shall not award a contract to a protested con- cern that the Area Office has deter- mined is not an eligible small business for the procurement in question.

§ 121.1010
filed, the contracting officer shall ter- minate the award.
(ii) If a timely OHA appeal is filed after contract award, the contracting officer must consider whether perform- ance can be suspended until an appel- late decision is rendered.
(iii) If OHA affirms the size deter- mination finding the protested concern ineligible, the contracting officer shall either terminate the contract or not exercise the next option.
(3) The contracting officer must up- date the Federal Procurement Data System and other procurement report- ing databases to reflect the final agen- cy size decision (the formal size deter- mination if no appeal is filed or the ap- pellate decision).
(4) Once SBA has determined that a concern is other than small for pur- poses of a particular procurement, the concern cannot later become eligible for the procurement by reducing its size.
(5) A concern determined to be other than small under a particular size standard is ineligible for any procure- ment or any assistance authorized by the Small Business Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 which requires the same or a lower size stand- ard, unless SBA recertifies the concern to be small pursuant to §121.1010 or OHA reverses the adverse size deter- mination. After an adverse size deter- mination, a concern cannot self-certify as small under the same or lower size standard unless it is first recertified as small by SBA. If a concern does so, it may be in violation of criminal laws, including section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the concern has already certified itself as small on a pending procurement or on an application for SBA assistance, the concern must immediately inform the officials responsible for the pending procurement or requested assistance of the adverse size determination.
(h) Limited reopening of size determina- tions. SBA may, in its sole discretion, reopen a formal size determination to correct an error or mistake, provided it is within the appeal period and no ap- peal has been filed with OHA. Once the agency has issued a final decision (ei- ther a formal size determination that is not timely appealed or an appellate
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
decision), SBA cannot re-open the size determination.

§121.1010 How does a concern become recertified as a small business?
(a) A concern may request SBA to re- certify it as small at any time by filing an application for recertification with the Government Contracting Area Of- fice responsible for the area in which the headquarters of the applicant is lo- cated, regardless of the location of par- ent companies or affiliates. No par- ticular form is prescribed for the appli- cation; however, the request for recer- tification must be accompanied by a current completed SBA Form 355 and any other information sufficient to show a significant change in its owner- ship, management, or other factors bearing on its status as a small con- cern.
(b) Recertification will not be re- quired nor will the prohibition against future self-certification apply if the ad- verse SBA size determination is based solely on a finding of affiliation due to a joint venture (e.g., ostensible subcon- tracting) limited to a particular Gov- ernment procurement or property sale, or is based on an ineligible manufac- turer where the eligible small business bidder or offeror is a nonmanufacturer on a particular Government procure- ment.
(c) A denial of an application for re- certification is a formal size deter- mination and may be reviewed by OHA at the discretion of that office.
(d) The granting of an application for recertification has future effect only. While it is a formal size determination, notice of recertification is required to be given only to the applicant.

The procedures for ap- pealing a formal size determination to OHA are set forth in part 134 of this chapter. The OHA appeal is an adminis- trative remedy that must be exhausted before judicial review of a formal size determination may be sought in a court.
(b) OHA will review all timely ap- peals of size determinations.

§121.1102 Are NAICS code designa- tions subject to appeal?
A NAICS code designation made by a procuring activity contracting officer may be appealed to OHA. The proce- dures governing OHA appeals are set forth in part 134 of this chapter. The OHA appeal is an administrative rem- edy that must be exhausted before judi- cial review of a NAICS code designa- tion may be sought in a court.

§121.1103 What are the procedures for appealing a NAICS code or size standard designation?
(a)(1) Any interested party adversely affected by a NAICS code designation may appeal the designation to OHA. An interested party would include a busi- ness concern seeking to change the NAICS code designation in order to be considered a small business for the challenged procurement, regardless of whether the procurement is reserved for small businesses or unrestricted. The only exception is that, for a sole source contract reserved under SBA’s 8(a) Business Development program (see part 124 of this chapter), only SBA’s Associate Administrator for Business Development may appeal the NAICS code designation.
(2) A NAICS code appeal may include an appeal involving the applicable size standard, such as where more than one size standard corresponds to the se- lected NAICS code, or a question relat- ing to the size standard in effect at the time the solicitation was issued or amended.
§ 121.1103
(b) The contracting officer’s deter- mination of the applicable NAICS code is final unless appealed as follows:
(1) An appeal from a contracting offi- cer’s NAICS code or size standard des- ignation must be served and filed with- in 10 calendar days after the issuance of the solicitation or amendment af- fecting the NAICS code or size stand- ard. However, SBA may file a NAICS code appeal at any time before offers are due. OHA will summarily dismiss an untimely NAICS code appeal.
(2)(i) The appeal petition must be in writing and must be sent to the Office of Hearings & Appeals, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW., Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416.
(ii) There is no required format for a NAICS code appeal, but an appeal must include the following information: the solicitation or contract number; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting officer; a full and specific statement as to why the NAICS code designation is erroneous, and argument in support thereof; and the name, address and telephone num- ber of the appellant or its attorney.
(3) The appellant must serve the ap- peal petition upon the contracting offi- cer who assigned the NAICS code to the acquisition and SBA’s Office of General Counsel, Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.
(c) Procedure after a NAICS code ap- peal is filed and served. (1) Upon receipt of the service copy of a NAICS code ap- peal, the contracting officer shall:
(i) Stay the date for the closing of re- ceipt of offers;
(ii) Advise the public, by amendment to the solicitation or other method, of the existence of the NAICS code appeal and the procedures and deadline for in- terested parties to file and serve argu- ments concerning the appeal;
(iii) Send a copy of (or an electronic link to) the entire solicitation, includ- ing amendments, to OHA;
(iv) File and serve any response to the appeal prior to the close of the record; and
(v) Inform OHA of any amendments, actions or developments concerning the procurement in question.

Subpart B—Other Applicable Provisions
WAIVERS OF THE NONMANUFACTURER RULE FOR CLASSES OF PRODUCTS AND INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS
§121.1201 What is the Nonmanufac- turer Rule?
The Nonmanufacturer Rule is set forth in § 121.406(b).
§121.1202 When will a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule be granted for a class of products?
(a) A waiver for a class of products (class waiver) will be granted when there are no small business manufac- turers or processors available to par- ticipate in the Federal market for that class of products.
(b) Federal market means acquisitions by the Federal Government from offerors located in the United States, or such smaller area as SBA designates if it concludes that the class of prod- ucts is not supplied on a national basis.
(1) When considering the appropriate market area for a product, SBA pre- sumes that the entire United States is the relevant Federal market, unless it is clearly demonstrated that a class of products cannot be procured on a na- tional basis. This presumption may be particularly difficult to overcome in the case of manufactured products, since such items typically have a mar- ket area encompassing the entire United States.
(2) When considering geographic seg- mentation of a Federal market, SBA will not necessarily use market defini-
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
tions dependent on airline radius, po- litical, or SBA regional boundaries. Market areas typically follow estab- lished transportation routes rather than jurisdictional borders. SBA exam- ines the following factors, among oth- ers, in cases where geographic seg- mentation for a class of products is urged:
(i) Whether perishability affects the area in which the product can prac- tically be sold;
(ii) Whether transportation costs are high as a proportion of the total value of the product so as to limit the eco- nomic distribution of the product;
(iii) Whether there are legal barriers to transportation of the item;
(iv) Whether a fixed, well-delineated boundary exists for the purported mar- ket area and whether this boundary has been stable over time; and
(v) Whether a small business, not currently selling in the defined market area, could potentially enter the mar- ket from another area and supply the market at a reasonable price.
(c) Available to participate in the con- text of the Federal market means that contractors exist that have been awarded or have performed a contract to supply a specific class of products to the Federal Government within 24 months from the date of the request for waiver, either directly or through a dealer, or who have submitted an offer on a solicitation for that class of prod- ucts within that time frame.
(d) Class of products is an individual subdivision within an NAICS Industry Number as established by the Office of Management and Budget in the NAICS Manual.
[61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 30863, May 15, 2000]
§121.1203 When will a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule be granted for an individual contract?
(a) Where appropriate, SBA will gen- erally grant waivers for an individual contract or order prior to the issuance of a solicitation, or, where a solicita- tion has been issued, when the con- tracting officer provides all potential offerors additional time to respond.
(b) SBA may grant a waiver after contract award, where the contracting

Small Business Administration
officer has determined that the modi- fication is within the scope of the con- tract and the agency followed the regu- lations prior to issuance of the solicita- tion and properly and timely requested a waiver for any other items under the contract, where required.
Example to paragraph (b): The Government seeks to buy spare parts to fix Item A. After conducting market research, the government determines that Items B, C, and D that are being procured may be eligible for waivers and requests and receives waivers from SBA for those items prior to issuing the solicita- tion. After the contract is awarded, the Gov- ernment determines that it will need addi- tional spare parts to fix Item A. The Govern- ment determines that adding the additional parts as a modification to the original con- tract is within scope. The contracting officer believes that one of the additional parts is also eligible for a waiver from SBA, and re- quests the waiver at the time of the modi- fication. If all other criteria are met, SBA would grant the waiver, even though the contract has already been awarded.
(c) An individual waiver for an item in a solicitation will be approved when the SBA Director, Office of Govern- ment Contracting, reviews and accepts a contracting officer’s determination that no small business manufacturer or processor can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the speci- fications of a solicitation, including the period of performance.
(d) Waivers for the purchase of soft- ware. (1) SBA may grant an individual waiver for the procurement of software provided that the software being sought is an item that is of a type cus- tomarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for pur- poses other than governmental pur- poses, and the item:
(i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public, or has been of- fered for sale, lease, or license to the general public;
(ii) Is sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Is offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace.
(2) If the value of services provided related to the purchase of a supply item that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section exceeds the value of the item itself, the pro-
§ 121.1204
curement should be identified as a service procurement, even if the serv- ices are provided as part of the same li- cense, lease, or sale terms. If a con- tracting officer cannot make a deter- mination of the value of services being provided, SBA will assume that the value of the services is greater than the value of items or supplies, and will not grant a waiver.
(3) Subscription services, remote hosting of software, data, or other ap- plications on servers or networks of a party other than the U.S. Government are considered by SBA to be services and not the procurement of a supply item. Therefore SBA will not grant waivers of the nonmanufacturer rule for these types of services.
[81 FR 34260, May 31, 2016]
§121.1204 What are the procedures for requesting and granting waivers?
(a) Waivers for classes of products. (1) SBA may, at its own initiative, exam- ine a class of products for possible waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule.
(2) Any interested person, business, association, or Federal agency may submit a request for a waiver for a par- ticular class of products. Requests should be addressed or hand-carried to the Director, Office of Government Contracting, Small Business Adminis- tration, 409 3rd Street SW., Wash- ington, DC 20416.
(3) Requests for a waiver of a class of products need not be in any particular form, but should include a statement of the class of products to be waived, the applicable NAICS code, and detailed in- formation on the efforts made to iden- tify small business manufacturers or processors for the class.
(4) If SBA decides that there are small business manufacturers or proc- essors in the Federal procurement mar- ket, it will deny the request for waiver, issue notice of the denial, and provide the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the sources found. If SBA does not initially confirm the existence of small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market, it will:
(i) Publish notices in the Commerce Business Daily and the FEDERAL REG- ISTER seeking information on small business manufacturers or processors,

announcing a notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for that class of products and affording the pub- lic a 15-day comment period; and
(ii) If no small business sources are identified, publish a notice in the FED- ERAL REGISTER stating that no small business sources were found and that a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for that class of products has been granted.
(5) An expedited procedure for issuing a class waiver may be used for emer- gency situations, but only if the con- tracting officer provides a determina- tion to the Director, Office of Govern- ment Contracting that the procure- ment is proceeding under the authority of FAR §6.302–2 (48 CFR 6.302–2) for ‘‘unusual and compelling urgency,’’ or provides a determination materially the same as one of unusual and compel- ling urgency. Under the expedited pro- cedure, if a small business manufac- turer or processor is not identified by a PASS search, the SBA will grant the waiver for the class of products and then publish a notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER. The notice will state that a waiver has been granted, and solicit public comment for future procure- ments.
(6) The decision by the Director, Of- fice of Government Contracting to grant or deny a waiver is the final deci- sion by the Agency.
(7) A waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for classes of products has no spe- cific time limitation. SBA will, how- ever, periodically review existing class waivers to the Nonmanufacturer Rule to determine if small business manu- facturers or processors have become available to participate in the Federal market for the waived classes of prod- ucts and the waiver should be termi- nated.
(i) Upon SBA’s receipt of evidence that a small business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver will be terminated by the Direc- tor, Office of Government Contracting. This evidence may be discovered by SBA during a periodic review of exist- ing waivers or may be brought to SBA’s attention by other sources.
(ii) SBA will announce its intent to terminate a waiver for a class of prod-
13 CFR Ch. I (1–1–22 Edition)
ucts through the publication of a no- tice in the FEDERAL REGISTER, asking for comments regarding the proposed termination.
(iii) Unless public comment reveals that no small business manufacturer or processor in fact exists for the class of products in question, SBA will publish a final Notice of Termination in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
(b) Individual waivers for specific solici- tations. (1) A contracting officer’s re- quest for a waiver of the Nonmanufac- turer Rule for specific solicitations need not be in any particular form, but must, at a minimum, include:
(i) A definitive statement of the spe- cific item to be waived and justifica- tion as to why the specific item is re- quired;
(ii) The proposed solicitation num- ber, NAICS code, dollar amount of the procurement, and a brief statement of the procurement history;
(iii) A determination by the con- tracting officer that no small business manufacturer or processor reasonably can be expected to offer a product or products meeting the specifications (including period of performance) re- quired by a particular solicitation. In- clude a narrative describing market re- search and supporting documentation; and
(iv) For contracts or orders expected to exceed $500,000, a copy of the State- ment of Work.
(2) Requests should be addressed to the Director, Office of Government Contracting, Small Business Adminis- tration, 409 3rd Street, SW., Wash- ington, DC 20416.
(3) SBA will examine the contracting officer’s determination and any other information it deems necessary to make an informed decision on the indi- vidual waiver request. If SBA’s re- search verifies that no small business manufacturers or processors exist for the item, the Director, Office of Gov- ernment Contracting will grant an in- dividual, one-time waiver. If a small business manufacturer or processor is found for the product in question, the Associate Administrator will deny the

§121.1206 How will potential offerors be notified of applicable waivers?
(a) Contracting officers must provide written notification to potential offerors of any waivers being applied to a specific acquisition, whether it is a class waiver or a contract specific waiver. This notification must be pro- vided at the time a solicitation is issued. If the notification is provided after a solicitation is issued, the con- tracting officer must provide potential offerors a reasonable amount of addi- tional time to respond to the solicita- tion.
(b) If a contracting officer does not provide notice, and additional reason- able time for responses when required, then the waiver cannot be applied to the solicitation. This applies to both class waivers and individual waivers.
